# RMN_Omri

1. Run BookNLP or another NER (Name-Entity Recognition) tool.
2. Create a names file with the NER output, where each line is composed 
   of the different names of the same entity separated with 
   at least a space (can use a comma).

   For Example:


   Harry Potter    Potter    Mr Potter
   
   Ron Wiesley     Wiesly    Ron    
   

3. Update Definitions File with the different file paths and 
   the amount of entities needs to be analized (the tool will analize the 
   most Definitions.num_of_entities reffered entities in the book).
4. Run the run.sh script.
