Now, twenty-six, reserved, pensive, de- meanor, found longing alone last, entirely alone, find about. There times felt whole life passing clamorous, smoke-filled room tedious argument bizarre matter dragged endlessly on. He neither knew argument wished take part it. The thing wanted pick walk out, go someplace else, place waited for—and would waited forever. Benya Trotsky—whom Yonatan never seen, even photograph—had run away kibbutz country 1939, six weeks Yonatan born. He raving theoretician, fiery student Kharkov chosen become conscientious laborer stone quarry Upper Galilee. Then lived kibbutz, where, principles, fell love Hava, Yonatan’s mother; loved honored Rus- sian fashion—with tears, oaths, feverish confessions. It late, Hava pregnant Yolek, moved cabin far end settlement. One evening, end winter, endless compli- cations, letters, threatened suicides, hysterical cries behind hayloft, group discussions, efforts find reasonable solution— nervous breakdown discreet medical treatment—it came Trotsky’s turn stand guard duty. Armed kibbutz’s antique revolver, faithfully watched us un- til break dawn, when, ['1 Yonatan', '2 Hava'] 187 
when, stricken ultimate despair, lay wait bushes laundry room. Leaping fired close range. Then, piercing howl shot dog, ran blindly cowshed, fired twice Yolek, finishing night milking, Sta- khanov, bull. With startled kibbutzniks, roused beds shots, hot heels, wretched man dived behind pile manure aimed last bullet brain. All shots missed targets, single drop blood shed, yet lovesick youth fled kibbutz, even country. He ended hotel tycoon Miami Beach, holiday resort East America. Once sent us large dona- tion construction music room. At another time wrote us letter strange Hebrew. In aspired, threatened, simply volunteered, Yonatan Lifshitz’s real father. On bookshelf parents’ home, hidden among pages old Hebrew novel, Yonatan found biblical- sounding love poem yellowing sheet paper, apparently composed Benyamin The lover poem though called Eleazar Maresha beloved Azuva daughter Shilhi. It entitled “But Their Hearts Were Not True.” At bottom page words penciled round, untroubled handwriting. But Yonatan ['1 Yonatan', '2 Benyamin'] 150 
Yonatan could deci- pher words letters Cyrillic. Never years parents much mentioned B. T. affair presence. Except once, fierce quarrel, Yolek said Hava “Twoj komediantand," hissed him: “Ty zhoju. Ty morderco.” (“You crook. You murderer.’’) The whole thing incredible, old-timers kib¬ butz sometimes recalled. From range two three feet, joker, managed miss bull! Yonatan ['1 Yolek', '2 Hava'] 54 
carried along stream strangers, intent affairs, utterly alone, face inscrutable theirs. And idea going overseas study working odd job, night watchman, say, atten- dant, even courier seen advertised brief notice Help Wanted column newspaper. Not vaguest notion courier might do, something told nonetheless, that’s you, friend. He imag- ined controls latest machines, instru- ment panels blinking lights, surrounded determined men cunning women. By last, rented room high skyscraper foreign city—no doubt America; doubt Middle West movies, would spend nights preparing entrance exams, acquiring profession would set high road life itself. And place waited for, would waited forever. At end autumn Yonatan got courage hint plans father. Though Yolek, capacity secretary kib- butz, initiated conversation. Early one evening cor- nered son foot stone stairs leading recreation hall urged take management tractor shed. Yolek low, secretive voice. A moist breeze blew them. The evening light clouded, light one rain next. A sodden bench covered wet walnut leaves. Wet walnut leaves already buried broken sprinkler pile burlap sacks. Yolek ['1 Yonatan', '2 Yolek'] 166 
Yonatan, “look, I simply don’t feel I’m right it.” “Not right it!” said Yolek. “You feel, don’t feel, you’re right, you’re right—what here, drama ensem- ble? Are bunch actors trying decide who’s going play Boris Godunov here? Tell me, all, you, people—the right person, wrong person, spoiled, capricious nonsense self-fulfillment, whatever hell call it. What’s right wrong person got work, eh?” “Look, I’m saying it’s me,” said Yonatan. “What good get angry? I’m made kind work, that's it. Besides, I’m second thoughts future altogether. And are, arguing young La- bor Party politicians we’re getting soaked. See, it’s raining again.” Which Yolek heard say. Or perhaps heard correctly preferred back off. At rate, replied: “Right then. Sleep give yes no. No point standing arguing night rain pouring heads. And speaking heads, ought get haircut.” One Saturday, Yonatan's younger brother Amos home short leave army, Yonatan him: Why talk much next year? You way knowing 11 year now.

They’re white clean, like snow fell every winter back Lupatyn.” And sound recorder children’s house would mingle cries birds, distance west, beyond citrus trees, beyond set- ting sun, engine passing freight train would bleat twice. Yonatan felt sorry parents. For Sabbath eves holidays men, women, children, nearly dressed best, freshly ironed white shirts blouses, assem- bled recreation hall sing old songs. For tin shed citrus groves sometimes stole twenty minutes work browse sports pages. For Rimona. For sun coming like bloodbath five summer morning, behind rocky hills east ruins abandoned Arab village Sheikh Dahr. For Saturday hikes among hills ruins—he Rimona, Rimona ['1 Yonatan', '2 Rimona'] 109 
Udi Anat, sometimes alone. In bed night, unable sleep, Yonatan thought whatever waiting must wondering would, didn’t hurry, move without him. In morning, padded porch barefoot put work clothes mud-caked boots, one yawned open days before, laughing mouth full rusty nails. Over frozen screams birds heard paged pick go, grapefruit grove, wholly different place, place would right place would own. He better late. Day day could feel something fading him. Was illness? Sleeplessness? Sometimes, accord, lips would murmur: Enough. That’s it. Finished. All beliefs ideas instilled since childhood shriveled. Rather, simply paled away heart. If discussed general kibbutz meeting repeated violations egalitarian ethic, need collective au- thority, even plain ['1 Yonatan', '2 barefoot'] 109 
southernmost column, would sketch naval destroyers paper napkins. If discussion turned particularly long one, would pro- ceed aircraft carriers, ships never seen except movies illustrated magazines. Whenever read paper growing threat war, would say Rimona, nonsense, that’s idiots ever do, turn sports section. Shortly high holidays resigned Youth Committee. Ideas opinions seemed fade away. A sadness rose fell like wail siren, though even fell, sometimes work chess game, could feel pierce like foreign body heart, throat, chest, gut, small some- thing bad wasn’t caught punished still shook fear day long night bed dark staying till hours—you crazy fool, you, done? Yonatan longed get far away grief like rich people books, Europe, fled snow-covered mountains escape summer heat warm south cheat winter. Once, two unloading sacks fer- tilizer truck, said friend Udi: "Hey, Udi, what’s biggest fraud world?" "Those meatballs Fayga cooks lunch three times week. Nothing stale bread little meat seasoning.” "No,” Yonatan persisted. "I mean really. The colossal fraud ever was.” "All right,” said Udi "I guess it’s reli- gion. Or communism. Or both.” "No,” said Yonatan. “It’s stories told children.” “Stories?” marveled Udi. “What world made think that?” “They exact opposite life, that’s were— got matches, Udi? Remember ['1 Yonatan', '2 Udi'] 200 
Remember time, commando raid Syrians Nukeib, left dead Syrian soldier half body shot away jeep put hands wheel stuck lit cigarette mouth took off? You remem- ber that?” Udi took time answering. He dragged sack truck, carefully squared form base new pile. Then, exhaling, scratching himself, turned around look Yona- tan, leaning side truck, smoking. Udi laughed. “What doing? Philosophizing broad day- light?” “Nonsense,” said Yonatan. "I thinking dirty little book I read English seven dwarfs really Snow White sleeping poisoned ap- ple. It fraud, Udi. That, Hansel Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood, The Emperor’s New Clothes, sweet stories everybody lived happily ever after. It fraud.” “Talking fraud, take matches pocket give back. Come on, let’s unload rest fer- tilizer Etan ['1 Udi', '2 Etan'] 121 
R. comes along. Only thirty go. Take deep breath.” Yonatan took deep breath calmed down. It almost surprise easy decision was. The obstacles turned minor. Shaving front mirror, would whisper: “He picked left.” The preceding summer, several months Yonatan made mind leave, sad thing happened wife. No Yonatan saw cause decision. Words like "cause" “effect” meant nothing him. Like bird migrations Ri- mona loved watch every autumn spring, Yonatan saw leaving time running out. Two years before, Rimona baby. Then, became pregnant again, delivered end sum- mer stillborn girl. The doctors advised trying again, least time being. But Yonatan ['1 Yonatan', '2 Rimona'] 99

In placid hand entered notations drumbeats villages Na- mibia, sketches Kikuyu witchdoctors' masks, descriptions Zulu ceremonies appeasement dead ancestors, med- ical amulets incantations land Ubangi-Shari. One day bought new record Haifa, On jacket naked black warrior spearing antelope. In English letters designed look like campfires, advertised The Magic Chad. Meanwhile, hay baled fields brought haylofts. The soil turned heavy plows hitched caterpillar tractors. The white-and-blue flames summer gave way low, gray light. Autumn came went. The days grew short bleary-eyed, nights grew ever deeper. Yonatan supervised orange picking, friend Udi care shipping harvest. One evening Udi ['1 Yonatan', '2 Udi'] 112 
Udi proposed cup coffee two review bills lading could prepare in- terim statement. ‘‘What’s rush? The season begun.” Yonatan mood budge. "If don’t patience accounting,” Udi ‘‘perhaps I myself.” ‘‘All right. Fine.” “Don’t worry, Yoni. I’ll keep filled in.” “You don’t to.” “What mean I don’t to?” “Listen, Udi. If you’d like boss around here, boss.” And left that. He didn’t like words didn’t trust them. And prepared talk Rimona ['1 Yonatan', '2 Udi'] 70 
Rimona slowly, deliberately, seeking antici- pate tears, arguments, pleas, accusations. But thought it, fewer justifications could find. Until left none. Not even one. He give Rimona bold truth. The bold truth might even expressed single sentence. “I can’t give more,” perhaps “I’m late.” But Rimona sure ask, “Giving whom?” or, “Late what?” What going say then? She might even burst tears gasp, “Yoni, you’re mind!” To knew could mumble, “Sorry,” or, “Well, that’s that, turn parents whole kibbutz him. Look, Rimona, something said words. Maybe like Magic Chad. Not magic Chad. There’s magic there. Or anywhere. What I mean is, I don’t choice, back's wall, say. So, I’m going. Yonatan evening several days off. If started accus- ing pleading, would simply clam up. All while, ['1 Rimona', '2 Yonatan'] 125 
while, like member underground eve uprising, careful go usual business. At crack dawn, would porch under- wear, climbing work clothes, conducting sleepy battle laces boots hating laughing one—wrapping shabby old battle jacket heading tractor shed. When rained, would cover head shoulders sack run cursing way shed. For couple minutes would push-ups filthy concrete floor checking oil, fuel, water old gray Ferguson, try get coughing, reluctant engine turn could take Udi crew teenage girls groves. Gath- ered around tin shed receive clippers, girls dimly brought Yonatan’s mind half-forgotten tale rep- robate nuns run away cloister consort woodsman living hut. Yonatan spoke working. Once, though, handing sports section Udi ['1 Udi', '2 Yonatan'] 107 
Udi break, remarked, "All right, that’s want: bills lading year, keep picture same.” At end day Yonatan would return home, shower, dress warm, clean clothes, light kerosene heater, sit clown paper. By four four-fifteen winter light would start dim, twilight time Rimona laundry put coffee cake table. Sometimes would wash mugs plates soon finished coffee. Occasionally, changing burned-out light bulb fixing leaky shower tap, might answer question asked listen wearily answered one his. One evening, radio news, certain Rabbi Nachtigall talked religious revival. He used phrase “a desert wasteland wilderness.” For rest night, and, in- deed, next day, Yonatan ['1 Yonatan', '2 Rimona'] 99 
The magic wasteland. Breathe deep, friend, told himself, calm down. You’ve got time world Wednesday. Tia, brownish-gray German shepherd, spent winter days sprawled floor heater. No longer young, seemed suffer rheumatism cold weather. In couple places coat grown threadbare, like worn-out rug. Sometimes would open eyes abruptly look tenderly made blink. Then would sink teeth thigh paws get rid invisible pest, rise shake coat, seemed least size large her. Her ears flattened, would cross room collapse heater, sighing shutting one eye, although tail would go twitching moment it, too, fell si- lent. Then eye would shut, would look world asleep. Tia developed sores behind ears, soon filled pus, veterinarian, visited kibbutz twice month check cows sheep, consulted. He prescribed salve also white powder mixed milk given drink. It hard get swallow it. He postpone again. From time time would go words prepared Rimona. But words? The wasteland Chad? Picks goes? The winter began take hold. Yolek flu suffered cruel pains back. One evening Yonatan ['1 Tia', '2 Yolek'] 164 
Yonatan dropped by, Yolek berated visiting often, refusing take shed, nihilism Israeli youth general. Hava “You look sad tired, Yonatan. Maybe take day two off. Rimona ['1 Yolek', '2 Hava'] 26

It raining hard. Orange picking came halt. The cheerful teenage girls sent kitchen stockrooms. Udi volunteered fix tin roof cowshed sheep pen blown away winds. And Yonatan ['1 Udi', '2 Yonatan'] 57 
Lifshitz agreed take shed father asked several weeks earlier. “I want know isn’t permanent arrange- ment,” said. “It’s now.’’ To Yolek replied, “Eh? Right! Good. Just get place shape, catch breath. Who knows? Maybe you’ll find unknown source self-fulfillment there. Maybe day fashions change kind work again.” “Just remember,” said Yonatan, “I haven’t promised anything.” And Yonatan put six hours day tractor shed. There wasn’t much except take routine care tractors make occasional repair simple enough. Most farm machinery, still frozen, slumbered away winter beneath tin roof rattled wind. The engine oil grew black viscous. The instrument panels clouded vapors. You mind try wake monsters sullen hibernation get running again. Let rest peace. I’m cold rain, told himself, long either.

stylish outfits copied knitwear magazines bought money studied carefully. He spoke little feminine voice always extreme caution, whatever said might implicate embarrass you. Once, coffee break, Yonatan, without looking newspaper, asked, “Say, Bolognesi, keep looking like that?” “Look shoe,” said Italian extraordinary deli- cacy, barely parting lips. “Your shoe she’s open water gets inside. I fix’a shoe right away?” “Don’t bother,” said Yonatan. “Thanks anyway.” He went right back debate two sports columnists upset yesterday’s League Cup semifinals. Then turned page started read Jewish orthopedist South America, also football star, come live Israel signed Jerusalem team. "I fix’a, thank’a,” insisted Bolognesi melan- choly logic. “Why thank’a like that? Wha’ for?” “For coffee,” said Yonatan. “You want I pour’a ’nother?” “No thanks.” “Look. 'Scuse’a me, call’a this? Again thank’a nothing? Wha’ for? No fix’a, thank’a. And get’a mad neither.” “All right,” said Yonatan. “No one’s getting mad. But don’t pipe down, Bolognesi, let read paper peace?” And said: No giving time. Tonight. You’ll tonight. Or, latest, tomorrow night. That afternoon, Yonatan home, lit kero- sene heater, washed hands face, sat wait Rimona ['1 Bolognesi', '2 Yonatan'] 181

Unfortunately, since made wet absorbent cotton, none six bul- lets Yonatan’s revolver able penetrate target’s skin. The man simply grinned rotten teeth hissed, “Ty zboju!” Yonatan eyes stood Rimona. “It’s quarter four,” said, “and getting dark. Why don’t sleep little I shower make us coffee?” “I wasn’t sleeping,” replied, “I thinking. Did know dictator Syria also gynecologist?” “You sleeping I came in,” said Rimona. “And I woke you. But we’ll coffee soon.” She showered changed clothes water boiled electric kettle. Slim, shapely, clean red sweater blue ['1 Etan', '2 Yonatan'] 104

another, complicated pattern, swept one away too. He gathered matches returned neatly box. A cracked old, bone-dry, mocking voice rasped within him: That joker, couldn’t even hit side bull three feet away. “But Their Hearts Were Not True.” Yonatan recalled possible answer. “I’ll mend it,” Rimona “You wear work.” “Oh, great!” said Yonatan. “It’ll sensation. I’ll show work one morning sport jacket. Maybe I’ll wear tie too, put white handkerchief breast pocket like secret agent, cut hair short father nagging do. Can hear, Rimona, strong wind is!” ‘‘The wind may strong, rain stopped.” ‘‘I’d better go then. Talk Shimon. Get kerosene. And I really ought sit Udi ['1 Yonatan', '2 Rimona'] 107

Yonatan suddenly thought abandoned Arab village Sheikh Dahr. This night, downpour might crumbling last earthen hovels, dust dust, ruins low stone walls might surrendering last, loose stone toppling down, earthward darkness, twenty years clinging mates. There couldn’t soul hills Sheikh Dahr night like this, one stray dog, single bird. What perfect hideout murderer like Bolognesi Benyamin Or me. No one there. Only stillness dark winter winds. Only smashed minaret mosque, twisted like trunk felled tree. A nest killers, told us childhood. A den bloody bandits. And leveled, told us could sleep peace night. The minaret sniped right kibbutz sliced two halfway direct mortar hit, hit, say, aimed commander-in-chief Jewish forces himself.

That's whole life. I don’t other. The one I keeps rushing by, right I’m paged get go give back time I’ve lost I arrive late? Yonatan stood up. His hairy hand groped light switch. When found last turned light, blinked moment, frightened, perhaps amazed, strange circuit connecting will, white switch wall, yellow light ceiling. He sat turned toward wife. “You’re falling asleep.’’ “I’m embroidering,” replied. “By springtime we’ll nice new tablecloth.” “Why didn’t turn light?” “I saw thinking I didn’t want disturb you.” “It’s quarter five,” said Yonatan, “and turn lights.

Then came back, filled heater tank, went wash hands, en- gine-oil stains around nails refused come off. “You got wet,” said Rimona “Never mind,” said Yonatan. “It’s right.

Tia fast asleep feet, spread latest issue Chessworld table concentrated hard trying solve difficult problem forgot cigarette holding ash fell pages. As relit cigarette, wave tiny tremors ran Tia’s fur head tail. Her ears stiffened momentarily, dropped again. But Rimona kept peace. So fragile silence tick bulky tin alarm clock reached bedroom. Rimona narrow hips, small, firm breasts, long hands fingers. From rear, thin, clean lines made look like girl onset puberty, like well-bred product finish- ing school, one taught stand erect, never wriggle behind, sit ramrod-straight knees kept together, always dutifully told. On rare occasions Rimona lifted long hair wear high bun, baring light nap neck, Yonatan beg let again, nakedness naked shamed him. Nearly always dark, widely set eyes veiled look. So lips, which, chill shaded, reflected imperturbable calm. Not even spoke, even smiled, vanish. And, event, ['1 Rimona', '2 Yonatan'] 139 
event, smiled infre- quently, smile beginning on, around, lips spreading slowly, hesitantly corners eyes. It always made seem like little girl shown some- thing little girls supposed see. Yonatan sure Rimona saw heard. I might well living expensive painting, thought angrily, governess training forever content. To banish thoughts, would resort words “my wife.” This wife, would whisper him- self. This Rimona, wife. This wife, Rimona. But words “my wife” seemed belong elsewhere—to families long standing, movies, houses full children, bedrooms, kitchens, maids—not Rimona, cared nothing, unless perhaps tribal amulets Swaziland, half-asleep, heart things her. My wife. She old brown jacket brain it’s wet. “Listen. Rimona. Maybe enough enough.” “Yes. I’m almost done. I've taken shoulders. Would like try on?” “No way.

It torn two places.” After ten o’clock news Yonatan stepped little porch smoke last cigarette. By small, round glow could see light, yet persistent, rain was. He liked feel cold skin inhale damp smell saturated earth. It dark see ground. He stood waiting, knowing what. He felt sorry brother Amos, might buddies awful night setting am- bush Arab infiltrators behind rocks mouth wadi near border. He felt sorry, too, baby stillborn Rimona summer. No one ever told done her. Yet somewhere darkness, thick mud, lay little body whose curious stirrings deep mother’s womb felt flat palm five months before. Again came sound muffled barking afar; where, ruins Sheikh ['1 Yonatan', '2 Rimona'] 141

He bent pick flickering butt, cast rain, breathed deeply tiny glow extinguished, murmured okay, okay, stepped back inside house. Rimona door behind him, drew curtains, stood couch bookcase like mechanical doll whose spring unwound. “Is it?” asked, added half-smile, “Yes. All right.” To Yonatan ['1 Suddenly', '2 Rimona'] 61 
Yonatan replied, “Yes. That’s it. Let’s go bed now.” “Now,” repeated. He couldn’t tell response meant promise, question, expression surprise, maybe consent. “In end I never talked Shimon. Never went see Udi accounts either.” “So didn’t,” said Rimona, “don’t let bother you. You’ll go tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow weather clear.” In double bed, curled separate heavy winter blanket, Rimona Yonatan ['1 Udi', '2 Rimona'] 59 
Go co sleep. Good night." The two lay still dark open eyes, touch- ing. She knew wasn’t asleep, knew knew Outside, low clouds swept eastward toward mountains kept peace, massive congealed, belonging themselves, yet strangers. 2 It took Tia two weeks recover sores. She drowsing heater. One evening, stopped breath- ing moment sleep, Yonatan might slipped away. Once discovered false alarm, made mind: Tomorrow night. That night young man arrived kibbutz. He walked way main road, distance six kilo- meters, entered village way muddy tractor road passed farm buildings. He soon enough encountered smells place sour fumes poultry run, stench sheepfold, pungent rot wet hay, fetid stink cow manure plugged sewage pipe barn, bubbly ferment moldy orange peels slop pile. The first person run across fading twilight Etan ['1 Tia', '2 Yonatan'] 128 
green look bordering equally gaiety despair, eyes nervously blinking. There was, fact, some- thing tense, frightened, and, time, fawning whole demeanor, something almost cunningly submissive. Etan R. refrained smiling, said harsh military voice, ‘‘All right, then. What I you.” This time even hint question. The young man reply once, instantly grasped secret Etan’s superiority lay delaying one’s answer decided play game himself. He hes- itated, shifting guitar case right hand left. Then, abruptly decisive movement, stretched hand said: "Hello there. I’m pleased meet you. My name Azariah I’d like stay here. I mean live here. The justice left today kibbutz. You won’t find anywhere else. I’d like live here.” Etan ['1 Etan', '2 Azariah'] 110 
Etan choice grasp hand held him. Azariah Gitlin responded once. “Look, comrade, I don’t want misunderstood start. I’m definitely one people come kib- butz kinds personal problems expect find heaven earth. But people still relate other. Everywhere eIse world there’s nothing hatred envy cru- elty. That’s I’ve come. I want join change life better. And relating others, I believe, one relates better one’s inner self. So I would like, I may, speak whoever charge.” A foreign accent.

R. shrugged twice way cowshed. Did guitar case really hold guitar? This country, reminded himself, full jerks. A guitar case guitars, things too. It’s anyone’s guess. He felt renewed uneasi- ness, perhaps stranger seemed ill-at-ease him- self. If young man’s looking someplace hide, Etan thought, couldn’t find better place kibbutz. Every- thing’s aboveboard, questions asked. The place still find little justice world kibbutz. An odd- ball? Well, we’ve got Bolognesi around knitting dresses, someone who’s looking justice. No skin back. Just safe side, though, Etan ['1 Etan', '2 Bolognesi'] 85 
nothing could stand them. How, then, penetrate smells, indoors, chit- chat, rugs straw mats, whispers, tunes, laughter, feel warm wool sweet fragrance coffee women cookies wet hair, rustle newspaper rattle dishes, crisping snow-white sheets spread four hands soft wide double bed lamplit room, rain drumming outside lowered blinds. Somewhere along path, rain, saw three ancient men standing, catching breath air, leaning toward one an- share secret perhaps huddle cold. They three wet bushes shaking wind. The music radios suddenly stopped, deep voice newscaster began speak solemn, determined, patriotic tone. The words carried gust wind. The drenched stranger trying hard remember Etan R.’s directions. The bakery cypress trees right place, long buildings deceived him. Instead two, four five them, lit like warships foggy port. Since path broke abruptly, found slosh flower beds. When low branch struck square face showered sharp needles water, humiliation filled anger stormed nearest flight stairs porch. He stood shivering finally rousing knocking lightly door.

Sometimes quick little smile unintentionally flitted across lips, though exact moment finally become aware vile machinations person talking to, fool- ish enough think could hide plots Yolek’s probing eyes. Yolek used talking great deal, addressing meet- ings, conferences, congresses, committees kinds, wittily. Whether making point joke paradox parable, master putting words to- gether powerful way, gave secret pleasure. For six years represented kibbutz Knesset, six months minister one Ben-Gurion’s first cabinets. Among friends movement Labor Party enjoyed reputation shrewd, almost clair- voyant intellect, one saw things others not. He’s strong man, people said, careful, clever fellow, honest fault, totally devoted cause. If you’re faced dif- ficult decision, said, could worse visit Kibbutz Granot spend time sounding Yolek out. “Excuse me,” said Azariah “I’m afraid I’m getting everything wet.” “I’m ['1 Yolek', '2 Azariah'] 178 
“I’m one told sit, young man. Why still standing? Sit. Not here. Over there, heater. Why, you’re soaking wet!” Azariah Gitlin placed guitar case chair Yolek sat stiffly politely, taking care lean back. Suddenly ['1 Azariah', '2 Yolek'] 34 
Suddenly jumped alarm, removed knapsack shoulder, laid great care guitar case though it, case, both, contained highly fragile object. Sitting close possible edge chair, grinned sight puddle forming beneath floor. “Please excuse me,’’ began, “but Comrade Yolek? Could I possibly minutes time?’’ Yolek immediate answer. Gently, settled aching back padded armchair, stretched legs infinite caution low footstool, fastened top button pajama top. Next reached pack cigarettes lay coffee table right, extracted one them, re- garded cunningly show nobody’s fool, then, something like wink, laid back pack with- lighting it. “Yes,” declared, turning left ear toward guest. “I’m really disturbing you? It’s right I get right down, say, brass tacks?” “Please do.” “Well, then, first all, please pardon sudden appear- ance. My invasion, I say. Not I don’t know rules formal etiquette abolished kibbutz, rightly so, ['1 Comrade', '2 Yolek'] 135 
so, I still must excuse myself. I came foot.” “Yes,” said Yolek. “I walked way junction. It’s good thing border raiders night like this.” “Yes, indeed,” said Yolek. “So you’re new boy fruit-packing plant last. Kirsch sent us.” “Not exactly.” “Eh?” “I’m afraid I someone else. I came see joining.” “What! You’re Kirsch’s assistant?” Azariah Gitlin looked floor. Humbled. Dis- graced. Lowest low. “I see,” said Yolek. “You indeed someone else. I beg pardon. ” During brief silence Yolek pitiful creature seated across wet socks, water streaming like sweat hot summer day. He noticed long, sensitive fingers like girl, frail shoulders, elongated face, restless expression, green eyes betrayed basic fear de- spair. He reached cigarette again, turned around suspiciously compare two ends, tamped gently be- tween fingers. With hand, pushed pack to- ward guest. Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Yolek'] 135 
Azariah Gitlin snatched cigarette, planted mouth, thanked Yolek thanked lighted match extended, began talk rush, swallowing words, despairing sentences halfway beginning new ones, gesturing continually hands, daring pause even inhale.

Azariah Gitlin. A weeks ago—three, three-and-a-quarter, exact—that is, roughly twenty-three days ago, discharged army. Honorably dis- charged. He document prove it. In writing. No, never kibbutz before, even visit. Except once, happened spend two hours Kibbutz Bet-Alfa. But two hours? Not enough time skin cat, speak. Besides, good friend army, young boy Kibbutz Ginegar, tried kill quarter- master’s office whose life he, Azariah, saved last minute. Not really mattered, way. All details were, speak, incidental. The main thing developed interest history kibbutz move- ment. He talked many people read number essays even novel—and, course, Comrade Lif- pamphlet Facing Future—so means stranger subject idea honor speaking with. Was truly disturbing him? The fact felt nothing contempt people made pil- grimages famous men’s homes simply rob time. Family? No. none. That is, brothers sis- ters, and, time being, wife children either. When could time start? All distant relatives, refugees Europe. No, positively preferred discuss them. Some people best talked about. Mum’s word, speak. “The shorter line, straighter. The fewer words, greater.’’ And would waste them. He simply wished accepted Kibbutz Granot. To strike roots soil, speak. That is, wanted part communal enterprise. Incidentally, day release army, ['1 Comrade', '2 Lif-'] 194

No, hadn’t tried publishing them. Still, plain fact two days ago, well midnight, sat alone table cup coffee run finger blindly list kibbutzim Israel. Wherever landed, decided, would go. “It’s fate steers horse veers.” Take Spinoza, example. A thousand years ago wisely written al- though human beings come world ignorant rea- son existence, one born desire realize best himself. And ended evening Kibbutz Granot. With experience realms ideology practical politics, Comrade Yolek surely encountered events seemed first glance pure coincidence, yet that, contemplated philosophically, revealed predestined character. That idea Spinoza’s. Need he, Azariah, apologize using arguments philosopher ['1 Comrade', '2 Yolek'] 124 
philosopher excommuni- cated fellow Jews? “If you’ll excuse saying so, Comrade Yolek, ban Spinoza gross injustice, speak, whereas kibbutz established put end injustice things.” A profession? In honesty admit didn’t yet one. When could time acquire one? He army twenty-three days. It would make happy taught agricultural skill like wheat growing wine culture would allow contribute society. Even broken clock right twice day. His job army? A technical sergeant, specialist halftracks, although, honest, official rank acting one. Not mattered. By way, demands. A roof head three square meals day, say. Perhaps little pocket money, customary kibbutzim. No, knew one Granot except splendid young man told way Yolek’s house great patience.

Not left army child Europe grown Hitler’s boot. No job, asked him, could difficult place one could go work every day sense joy community. If wasn’t mistaken, whole idea kibbutz. In word, would gladly whatever asked him. He wasn’t choosy spoiled. On contrary, might well said tough nails. During war, Stalin put Russian people bluntly. ‘‘Each wants eat, get butt feet!” Pozhalusta. ‘‘Yes, Comrade Yolek, yes, course, I know I probation first. You can’t thing army either without going basic training. Excuse me, I’m sorry, I really didn’t mean get ashes floor. I’ll clean right away. No, I beg pardon, Comrade Yolek. It’s fault I’ll clean up. And wipe water that’s dripped wet clothes. Forgive me, though. Are chance hurry? I know I’ve talking lot, I’d better stop get wrong idea me. Basically I’m quiet, even introspective type. Just tell I’ll scram. A thousand years ago Spinoza quoting Klatzkin’s translation—that love generosity alone conquer another man’s heart. Well, it’s finally stopped raining. Perhaps ['1 Comrade', '2 Spinoza'] 186 
Perhaps would like leave try luck kibbutz?” All time Yolek sat there, shifting chair find comfortable position sore back. Without forgoing usual cunning look, listened tactfully guest’s harangue. Now interrupted ask brief, calculated ques- tion stranger’s credentials. Whenever failed fol- low verbal torrent, would lean vigorously forward, turn good ear Azariah, say, “Eh?” This inevitably made Azariah jumble things even more. With new proverb platitude, Yolek ['1 Yolek', '2 Azariah'] 66 
Although found hard make mind, one thing clear. The newcomer wasn’t scoundrel. Thus, Azariah fell silent suggesting perhaps try luck elsewhere, Yolek warmly, “Very well, then.’’ The newcomer’s face lit up, laughed—an overly loud laugh. “You mean say I’ve convinced you?” “Wait,” said Yolek. “First you’ll drink glass hot tea. Then we’ll talk next step.” “Thank you.” “Yes, thank you, no, thank you?” “No, thank you. Not right now.” “You won’t tea,” said Yolek, surprised disap- pointed. “What pity. Be wish.

There work give them, nowhere put up, one responsible them. It reason alone Yolek couldn’t recommend Azariah trial period. Not, way, put much stock trial periods. A trained eye could see glance stuff man made of. And couldn’t, simply proved man closed personality ten years wouldn’t help fig- ure out. There always, course, exceptions, ex- ceptions kibbutzim never lasted long. All this, needless say, level generalities. “In regard specific case, I’m sorry tell moment room you. If come back early summer, there’s lots weeding fruit thinning do, even midsummer, begin picking grapes citrus fruit, I’ll, course, reconsider. Maybe we’ll vacant rooms then.

Are sure won’t glass tea first, though? No? No is, then. “Everyone right opinion, won’t force any- thing here. And yet, young friend, I must say everyone right opinion, every opinion right. Spinoza, now. Did learn school? Or discover yourself? In case, perhaps you’ll good allow correct slightly. It hasn’t thousand years. You said lived thousand years ago. But Spinoza Amsterdam three hundred years ago. That’s long time too, course—but still. “Eh? You’ll ['1 Hava', '2 Spinoza'] 136 
You’ll walk? But walk way junction weather like this, dark? Didn’t I tell there’s truck leaving city? Are trying punish us? There’s need act foolishly. And see it’s starting rain again. Look here, what’s matter you? You surely don’t expect keep force? Suit your- self, though. Have good trip. If happen change mind, you’ll find truck square front din- ing room.

Yolek finished speak- ing. His socks left wet prints behind floor. He picked guitar case right hand, hung knapsack left shoulder, bravely managed polite, intimidated smile. Nevertheless, desperation even terror eyes, terror naughty child caught act. Yolek, still armchair, cocked head look side- Ways something confirmed previous previous suspi- cions. The sense right gave usual sharp pang pleasure. The visitor stumbled toward door, grabbed hold furiously began pulling handle meant open outward. His predicament temporarily dumbfounded him. Mur- muring something Yolek failed catch, put guitar case down, figured secret door, and, outside, cast back anguished look. “Goodbye,” said twice. “Forgive me. "Just minute,” called Yolek. “Wait.” Panic-stricken, young man turned around, bumping shoulder door. There flare fear green eyes, though trap closed last minute, escape seemed sure. “Yes, sir.” “Did say halftracks? What say army?” “Nothing special. I technical sergeant. Not exactly sergeant. An acting sergeant, private first class. “What exactly technical sergeant?” "I’m going back army!" Azariah ['1 Yolek', '2 Azariah'] 158 
Gitlin shot bach fiercely, bristling like cornered cat. "And one make me! I honorably discharged three-and-a-quarter weeks ago." "Easy there, young man. Easy there. Perhaps could sim- ply explain technical sergeant does? Anything garage work?" At lights relit young man's face, though, abandoned every hope, unexpectedlly acquitted charges. Yolek felt curiosity stir dimly. There something newcomer aroused suspicion approbation time. “Yes, Comrade yes, it’s definitely garage work, lots too, armaments, combat gear, engine testing, every- thing, mechanics, automotive electronics, maintenance, repairs, even ballistics metallurgy, everything.” He spoke breakneck speed, single long breath. “Eh?” “Combat gear. I said armaments combat gear.” “All right, right, that’s well. But know fix tractors farm machinery don’t you? You do? Ah! We’re singing different opera now. You saw ad evening paper? You didn’t? Honestly? No, no, there’s need swear. I believe you. I believe everyone I catch first lie. I’ll tell what, though. ['1 Yolek', '2 Comrade'] 148

After supper, Yonatan Rimona home din- ing room. He couldn’t remember mother Hava ['1 Yonatan', '2 Rimona'] 76 
Hava asked came table end meal. He could recall saying tonight question. The two stood several minutes heater thaw out. They close oulder grazed arm. He enough taller look rain-drenched hair falling gently shoulders, left one rather right. Had wished, could stroked it. But stooped turned flame heater instead. The room lit usual reddish-brown light cast heavy lamp shade. Everything place. Everything neat tidy. Rimona even folded newspaper stashed low shelf belonged. Even floor tiles gave subtle scent cleanliness. Tia sprawled heater. It would seemed house perfect peace crying child next-door apartment. “These walls,” said Rimona. “What’s wrong?” “They’re thin. You’d think made paper.” It seemed meaningful kind crying, neither whine tantrum, child beyond wall broken toy loved knew alone blame. A woman sought soothe him. Only tone voice reached Yonatan ['1 Rimona', '2 Tia'] 131 
Yonatan Rimona; words could made out. When Yonatan asked Rimona wanted know asked. Did want explain something chessboard perhaps? Although never played chess other, always willing sit half hour so, pieces arranged board, ex- plained various strategies: Nimzowitsch Opening, King’s Indian Defense, flanking versus direct attack, correct way play Queen’s Gambit, sacrifice piece sake tactical advantage. Rimona ['1 Yonatan', '2 Rimona'] 57 
Rimona found pleasant listen things. If cared set pieces, added, would make coffee, fetch embroidery, minute. Although Yonatan didn’t reply, Rimona make coffee. Like soldier caught crossfire, spun wildly around, stepped away heater, crossed bookcase, stood back room. His eyes finally fell old photograph Rimona ['1 Yonatan', '2 Rimona'] 45 
Rimona framed placed among books, black-and-white snapshot two taken hike Judean Desert. He astounded dis- cover alone. Behind her, lower right- hand corner, appeared strange, hairy, uncouth leg short pants army boots. Now time make move, say crucial thing. Doing best steady himself, finally managed say, angrily, “My cigarettes. Did chance see cigarettes?” Rimona came room carrying tray two mugs coffee, pastry, small blue Bokhara creamer. “Why don’t sit down? You pour milk cof- fee I get fresh pack drawer. There’s need upset.’’ “Forget it!’’ snapped Yonatan. And then, bitingly, “Who hell asked fresh pack? My cigarettes there. Look, right nose! On radio. What say?” “I didn’t say anything. You talking, Yoni.” “I thought did. Maybe started changed mind. Or maybe meant to. Here, I’ll pour’a da milk. That’s Bolognesi it, ‘pour’a.’ I always feel I’m inter- rupting you, even you’re silent.” “How strange,” said Rimona, though slightest touch wonder voice. “And maybe ['1 Rimona', '2 Bolognesi'] 153 
that’s wasted. “Did forget?” asked Rimona, smile. “Forget what?” “I’m still waiting.” “Waiting?” said Yonatan amazement. He felt moment’s panic. What could mean? Waiting what? Did already know? But couldn’t possibly. “I don’t get it,” added. “Waiting what?” “For set chessboard, Yoni. And I’ll turn radio. There’s Bach fugue on. I’ve already brought em- broidery, told bother getting ciga- rettes would, forgot. Don’t get up. I’ll you.” Some minutes later sat facing twin arm- chairs. Music came radio.

Far away here.” Rimona lowered shoulders. She slowly touched upper lip fingertip, like slow pupil working math problem. He bent see tears. There tears. She seemed supremely concentrated, lost thought. Her attentiveness lapsed wandered back music. It’s radio, thought Yonatan. All music completely spaced out. Ever quietly she’s going mind, else she’s total halfwit along I didn’t notice. She’s even listening music. It goes one ear like ticking clock sound rain drainpipe. “Turn radio. I’m talking you.” Rimona turned off. Irately, enough, Yonatan plug socket. There moment’s silence. The rain outside stopped. From neighboring apartment came sound something falling, tower blocks collapsed rug. ['1 Rimona', '2 Yonatan'] 197

Get up, crazy nut, said, thought you’d killed slaughtered Bedouin. Yonatan looked around filthy, shift- ing sand dunes polluting air dust hideous mountains distance. Yonatan turned radio, station air. He took sheet blankets linen chest, went bathroom wash brush teeth. When emerged, Rimona made bed setting clock twelve o’clock news army broadcasting service. The announcer expressed grave concern possible results conference Arab military chiefs scheduled next day Cairo. The situation gave signs rapid deterioration. Yonatan ['1 Yonatan', '2 Rimona'] 99

Here put first night, going stay. The man absolutely material wants. Sometimes, late night, wake hear dream chords guitar. Between sessions, one barefoot would volunteer make coffee assembled. With generous smile would thank her. Later, visitors would take leave, new group would arrive, afar, inspiration, guid- ance, simply bask presence. He would exhort prepare protracted struggle. He would preach need perseverance. He would reject hand political gim- micks tactical adventures. Of course, would make deadly enemies. He would take newspapers, compassionately yet ironically citing Spinoza ['1 late', '2 barefoot'] 140

One day, perhaps even next summer, Prime Minister Esh- kol would inquire inner circle eighth wonder world. Why bring lad see I size myself? When Azariah invited Eshkol’s office, secretary would allot ten minutes. Half hour later, Eshkol order hold calls. He would sitting chair uttering word, overwhelmed Azariah’s analysis nation’s affairs. From time time would dare pose question, jotting answers pencil little scraps paper. The hours would go by. Evening would descend outside windows, yet Eshkol ['1 Azariah', '2 Eshkol'] 103 
Eshkol would refrain turning lights, rapt would revelations Azariah’s monastic years. Finally, would rise seat, lay hands Azariah’s shoulders, say, "'Yingele, you’re staying me.

Now let drop bon mot eternal, tragic con- flict high ideals gray realities, social vision revolutionary passions human heart. At one point Yonatan thought caught phrase “the clear, certain premises mental life,’’ began feel weary longing clear, bright faraway meadow bathed sun- light banks broad river, perhaps Africa.

“A long ago. I’m one-hundred-percent service.” To remark added full name, volunteered in¬ formation secretary kibbutz told Yonatan’s name Yonatan Hava ents. He concluded quoting little proverb. “This way,” said Yonatan. “Watch out. These steps slip- pery.” “The laws nature such,” said Azariah, “that accidents.

He’s like lost wet puppy, thought Yonatan, wagging tail whole rear end get like pet him. Fat chance! You’re barking wrong tree, pal.

He nodded several times, understanding Yonatan’s dilemma well, made vague remark importance creative intuition even purely technical matters, patiently blew puff warm breath across musicianly fingers. “Well, say?” asked Yonatan not- ing time, much surprise, glow affection newcomer’s face.

Finally, five six sharp backfires, engine fell silent. From outside shed, shrill, bitter, piercing, came caws birds screaming wind. Azariah Gitlin opened eyes. “That’s it?” asked smile. “That’s it,” said Yonatan. “It’s every time.” “Did ever try putting gear soon starts?” “What think?” said Yonatan. “And happened?” “What think?” “Listen,” concluded Azariah. “It’s strange.” “You’re telling me.” Yonatan dryly. He longer slightest doubt newcomer another queer fish out-and-out imposter. “What I’m telling you,” said Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 156 
Azariah Gitlin gently, “is curiosity may killed cat, it’s haste killed bear.” Yonatan “And now,” said Azariah ['1 Gitlin', '2 Yonatan'] 17 
Azariah Gitlin, “I need time think. If don’t mind, I’ll take minutes it.” “To think?” snickered Yonatan. “Why not? Be guest.” He rose, picked ripped, greasy sack, sat crate, wrapped tattered burlap around torn boot, lit cigarette. “Fine. You go ahead think. When you’re done, raise right hand.” He yet finished cigarette when, utter amazement, young man declared, “I’m done.” “You’re done what?” “I’m done thinking.” “And what, may I ask, think of?” “I thought,” said Azariah hesitantly, “that maybe, finish cigarette, might start working tractor.” The entire repair job performed Yonatan twenty minutes. Clean, pale, alert, Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 98 
Azariah Gitlin stood looking on, telling exactly reading instructions manual, presiding operation afar like one grandmasters Yonatan play blind chess without pieces board. Only course proceedings young man bother step onto tread peer bowels engine. Using tip screw- driver, adjusted contact watchmaker’s precision climbed again, taking great pains avoid grime. As soon tractor started up, began gurgle steadily softly like purring animal. The gears successfully tested. The engine ran ten minutes without hitch. At last Yonatan ['1 Gitlin', '2 Yonatan'] 76 
Yonatan switched said voice sounded loud sudden silence, “Yup. That’s it.” He couldn’t decide whether newcomer magician mechanical genius, whether whole problem simple begin could easily solved tired, cold, preoccupied last days. Azariah Gitlin, hand, celebrated little triumph delirious outbreak, slapping companion repeatedly back singing praises Yonatan oughly revolted. He reveled recounting times mi- raculously confounded enemies, among evil major called Zlotshin, Zlotshnikov, beautiful female officer army garage deeply ambivalent feelings him, Ph.D. idiot engineering Haifa Technion failed come mechanical solution he, Aza- riah, hit upon once. He talked brainstorms, human brain general, Major Zlotkin Zlotnik, driven mad envy, seductive advances, revolutionary technical device developed cun- ningly pirated away Major Zlotshkin’s brother-in-law, made mint it, bought nice little island eastern Aegean, bombarded Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 123 
Azariah letters full threats, expressions admiration, offers joint ventures. Yonatan half listened ponderous silence. At last Azariah silent too, wipe bluish oil stain spattered tip shoe. “All right,” said Yonatan. “It’s quarter-past-eight. Let’s go breakfast dining hall. Then we’ll come back see else needs done around here.” On way dining hall, still compulsively talking, Azariah ['1 Yonatan', '2 Azariah'] 55 
Azariah told two different jokes passengers Polish trains, one involving anti-Semitic priest big fat gen- eral, whom, first despite great malice sec- ond despite great strength, outwitted Jews. He alone laughed punch lines, caused nervously joke old canards one laughed tellers. Yonatan noticed first time newcomer faint accent. It well concealed barely identifiable. The “l’s” bit soft, “r’s” slightly prolonged, “k’s” sometimes expelled palate swal- lowed something distasteful. Obvious effort gone over- coming accent. Perhaps effort, speed spoke, Azariah tripped words, nearly choking them. At times would break mid-sentence, fling back breach once. No two lonelinesses ever alike, thought Yonatan. If two people could really anything common, might pos- sible become truly close. Just look poor bas- tard trying hard cheer make laugh he’s unhappy himself. You see he’s twisted inside—too sen- sitive, cocksure, obsequious, time. We get kinds strange types ['1 Yonatan', '2 Azariah'] 141 
flying every direction. The electric wires pricked hummed odd tune. “After breakfast,” said Yonatan, “you go storeroom ask pair work clothes. You 11 find Peiko's old boots crate behind diesel oil. Peiko’s man ran place years.” When two stopped wash stand out- side dining hall, Azariah’s long, wistful, delicate fingers caught Yonatan’s eye. The sight made think Rimona. And moment saw sitting friends far end hall, grasping mug tea hands. He knew still full holding it, usual, warm fingers. For second wondered might thinking morning, scolded once. What I care she’s thinking? All I want far away all. Through breakfast Azariah Gitlin kept coming strong, Yonatan people joined table, Yashek little Shimon sheep pen. Having introduced himself, asked might names well. Then, peculiar sort merriment, told sleep- less night barber’s room, where, horror movie, cracked voice side wall began speaking stroke midnight. He saw—waking dreaming, still couldn’t say—a ghost mumbling sorts Biblical abracadabra dead tongue, Chaldean perhaps Hittite. He related tale tractor, fishing compli- ments Yonatan ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 166 
Yonatan two men might suitably impressed. Indeed, though less day passed since arrival kibbutz, urged rest days beginning work, sixth sense told time waste, rose early morning ran tractor shed, thus proving—or rather, demonstrat- ing—no, right word justifying—yes, justifying faith placed high hopes pinned him. Of course, whatever praise deserved due intuition knowledge skill, since minute heard sound engine brainstorm. As saying went, “If wagon stuck mud, tell Ivan push put thinking cap.” Whenever one tablemates reacted exuberance vague smile, Azariah guffawed loudly redoubled efforts. And Yonatan two mugs coffee handed one, couldn’t find enough words thank him. “A guiding hand brought Comrade ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 103 
Shimon, hiding behind sports section, declared gruffly weren’t Russians would take care Arabs quickly enough one two healthy kicks rear. “We like think everything depends us. But doesn’t. Eshkol isn’t exactly Napoleon. Some things don’t depend any- one,” Yonatan others. At point Azariah ['1 Eshkol', '2 Yonatan'] 43 
on, Azariah launched fresh harangue wisdom looking Spinoza “Ratio,” is, per- manent laws underlying multifarious phenomena wrongly la- beled coincidence. But soon noticed others finished breakfast waiting pause breath could get go. This realization, time desperately trying extricate lengthy sen- tence, led break completely turn back food. He began gulping keep anyone waiting, go wrong pipe trigger outburst coughing. “Take time,” Yonatan ['1 Azariah', '2 Spinoza'] 62 
Yonatan said calmly. “These two goof-offs hurry haven’t earned salt salad yet, we’ve already done damn good job Caterpillar. Now day.” Outside, gray rain continued fall, stubbornly insensibly, like frozen madness. That evening Azariah Gitlin, carrying guitar, knocked Lifshitzes’ door. Freshly shaved washed, curly locks drip- ping wet rain, begged pardon come un- invited. Nevertheless, read somewhere kibbutzim had—and rightly so—done away rules formal eti- quette. Moreover, Yolek last night drop Yonatan ['1 Azariah', '2 Yolek'] 72 
Yonatan Rimona get acquainted. Besides which, room assigned—the electric bulb weak couldn’t read paper book, much less write. And decided try luck drop visit. Yes, thank you, would love cup coffee. There old Russian proverb went, “The man friend Devil’s end.” Not exact translation, least preserved rhyme. Were sure wasn’t in- truding? With kind permission, promised over- stay welcome. He brought guitar occurred Yonatan might like music, case would gladly play simple tunes. Indeed, three might even sing bit. He said “friend” rather “wife” word, right-sounding kibbutz, heard Comrade ['1 Rimona', '2 Yonatan'] 89 
ago. He wanted give cyclamen friend Yonatan’s friend. Please. It was, all, token. Rimona put kettle boil. Yonatan plate small cakes Bokhara creamer. Tia ['1 Rimona', '2 Yonatan'] 24 
Tia shuffled guest, pressed nose knees, sniffed, sighed, crawled lie beneath couch, tail protruded; thumped several times rectangular gray rug spread floor coffee table. Four carefully arranged rows books stood shelves. Heavy brown curtains cov- ered window door leading porch. The whole room seemed peace, even picture wall, dark bird perched red brick fence. Shamelessly piercing surrounding murk like golden spear diagonal shaft sunlight. Lancing brick bottom picture, caused blossom nimbus blinding light. The bird looked weary; bill slightly, thirstily agape, eyes closed. The electric kettle whistled. Rimona brought coffee table. You must like new job,” said. “Yonatan tells you’re good it.” Careful avoid eyes, Azariah happy made Yonatan ['1 Rimona', '2 Azariah'] 109 
harm country fellow man. These delicious. Did bake yourself, Rimona?’’ “They come box,” said Rimona. I noticed morning, said Yonatan, “that every little thing excites him.” “I’m sorry teacher,” said Rimona. Yonatan, said Azariah, sharp eye, speak. There’s point pretending I’m excitable. Still, I’ll say again, governess never made pastry good I boy. I tire stories govern- ess, sometime children I’ll tell her. Children love listening me, especially little ones. Maybe know legend Jewish peddler came village terrible Jew-killers lured children flute drowned river. Little children Would follow hell high water, I tell loveliest stories frightening frightening.” "We happen,” said Yonatan slow, sleepy voice, "not children.” Azariah profoundly bitter smile began form around Rimona’s lips without ever touching them. Before dying away, momentarily reached shaded eyes. Looking neither them, said, “We little girl lost her,” adding, pause, “Whether happened, say, I know. But I’d like know happen.” There silence. Yonatan ['1 Yonatan', '2 Azariah'] 150 
Yonatan rose, tall lean. He col- lected empty coffee mugs took sink. While room, Azariah noticed Rimona’s blond hair fell back shoulders, left right. He noticed slender stem neck fine lines forehead cheeks. She was, thought, beautiful, Yona- tan handsome, loved both, even envied them. He winced think pained mentioning children, felt shame self-loathing almost glad hear none. I must make happy always, thought. I must get close they’ll never able without me. Her pale, Christian beauty painful. I’ll never let know vile I really am. Azariah Gitlin vaguely began hope girl might hurt him, wrong, would make amends for. And yet couldn’t imagine might come about. When Yonatan room, Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 111 
Azariah looked floor see shut copy Witches Witch Medicine lying open end couch. As put back place middle shelf, Azariah politely asked might smoke. Yonatan shirt pocket pack expensive American cigarettes Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 32 
Azariah given afternoon present handed him. “Long ago,” said Azariah, “in ancient Greece, philosopher believed soul resides body like sailor ship. As lovely image is, must rejected. Another Greek philosopher wrote soul dwells body like spider web, humble opinion much closer truth. Using powers observation I developed long, unhappy years wandering, I no- ticed good quarter hour ago someone must like play chess. If I may permitted hazard guess, some- one you, Yonatan, friend.” As Yonatan board set pieces, Azariah ['1 philosopher', '2 Yonatan'] 80 
Azariah delivered boastful remarks, retract apologetically point out, “A great philosopher observed winner Olympic medal neces- sarily fastest man Greece simply fastest man race.” Yonatan ['1 philosopher', '2 Yonatan'] 25 
Lifshitz Azariah Gitlin smoked played silence Rimona radio bag embroidery unopened lap, intensely absorbed dream own. Yonatan’s eyes kept filling tears neither wiped away bothered explain guest. Rimona ['1 Azariah', '2 Rimona'] 28 
Rimona still removed pine branches vase since found flowers replace them. After six seven moves, Azariah blundered. He best come smile, remarking that, even though game good almost begun, first probe. Yonatan begin again. But Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 36 
Azariah refused. He blamed thunder rolls outside inability concentrate and, kind irritable sports- manship, insisted playing bitter end. ‘‘He never tasted defeat never know triumph sweet.” At Rimona pressed embroidery lap looked notice many tiny, agitated wrinkles came went around eyes. He already single-handedly eaten every pastry large plate except sole survivor, last concession good manners kept absentmindedly picking putting again. Once even raised way lips giving last-minute start gently replacing it. Rimona opened bag began embroider. “That man said killed bullet. If died in- stantly, means didn’t suffer. Did say name Yehoshafat?” “That’s right,” said Azariah. “But I’m afraid I’ve made laugh me. I always say opposite I should.” “Your move,” said Yonatan. With sudden burst fervor, Azariah remaining bishop along diagonal reached nearly one end ['1 Rimona', '2 Azariah'] 127 
end board other. “Not bad,” said Yonatan. “Watch out!” crowed Azariah. “I’m warming up!” Indeed, within space moves, recklessly sac- rificing knight two pawns, young man reversed apparently hopeless situation even threatening Yonatan’s king. “Do see that?” asked, flushed success. At exact moment, however, seemed run inspiration, un- necessarily losing another pawn initiative. Yonatan con- tinued play patiently, cagily, calculated precision. Azariah, hand, kept throwing away ingeniously gained ad- vantages committing mistakes would made be- ginner blush. Rimona embroidery went open win- dow air smoke-filled room. Tia ['1 Yonatan', '2 Rimona'] 87 
Tia rose too, arched back, moved closer table, panting short, rapid breaths, pink tongue hanging out, eyes glued master ears cocked forward, straining miss word move. Azariah Gitlin burst laughing. “Give time,” said, “and I’ll teach dog play chess. You’d surprised dog learn. Once, I lived camp new immigrants, I taught Yemenite’s goat dance hora.” Rimona window, returned couch, said, continuing thoughts loud, must sad spend many hours alone barber’s shack. In bottom closet, believed, small, unused electric kettle could lend Azariah. Before left would also give coffee sugar pieces pastry liked much. “Check,” said Azariah. His voice cold. “But good do?” marveled Yonatan. “I go here. Or here.” “I’m pressing home attack,” said Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Rimona'] 115 
giggle. “Thank you, Rimona,” added. “When you’re nice me, could I possibly go hurt Yonatan’s feel- ings inflicting, speak, defeat him.” “Your move,” said Yonatan. As gesture friendship I offer draw.” “Hold there,” said Yonatan. “Why don’t first take good look what’s happening rook. You’re bad trouble.” If so, I lost interest banal, repetitious, and, mind saying so, boring game least ten minutes ago. Azariah's reply almost singsong. “You,” said Yonatan, “have lost.” So I have, said Azariah, trying force comically gay expression. “And I,” said Yonatan, “have won.” There now, said Rimona. The kettle’s boiling again.” They drank coffee Azariah demolished another plate pastry. When gone, took guitar battered case, moved away hosts, sat footstool near kitchen door. Tia him, sniffing shoes. At first picked two three simple popular tunes, sometimes humming softly along, started playing melancholy melody neither knew. “That sad,” said Rimona. Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Tia'] 146 
Azariah flinched. “You didn’t like it? I play kinds things. Just tell what.” “It beautiful,” said Rimona. Thoughtfully, Yonatan gathered survivors board arranged two rows, black white, table. “That fine,” said. “I don’t know much mu- sic, I could see played piece carefully, worried might get carried away snap strings. It made think quickly figured wrong Caterpillar. If you’d like, I’ll say word Srulik. He’s charge music around here. For now, though, we’d better think going dining hall sup- per.” “Comrade Yolek,” said Azariah, “mistook Srulik I myself, course, believe pure coincidence. Everything happens reason.” Before left, Rimona ['1 Yonatan', '2 Srulik'] 98 
Rimona gave Azariah Gitlin electric kettle, bag sugar, coffee, yet pastry: Yonatan maged drawers found new light bulb Azariah’s room. One look it, though, enough establish wouldn’t brighter old one. Over supper Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 33 
Azariah began lecture hosts, struck Yonatan tiresome. He went chewing si- lence piece bread helping generously salad double portion omelet. Rimona, however, listened attentively every word. At one point, asked Azariah stave political disaster, went head forgot vegetables put plate. He began rehearsing ingenious plan engineering big-power confrontation would enable little Israel slip safely away even come ahead. During recital, Etan ['1 Yonatan', '2 Azariah'] 61 
Etan R. stopped table in- terrupted Azariah “Well, well, I see didn’t get lost all. I live last room swimming pool. If chance find justice around here, come tell right away nip bud.” From across hall, Yonatan’s mother Hava ['1 R.', '2 Azariah'] 39 
Hava waved hello. Little Shimon, mug hand, came ask Yonatan lend newcomer days hope might work miracles sheep pen well. Before parted went separate ways, Rimona vited Azariah, touching elbow, come evening chat play chess bring guitar felt like it. Once back barber’s shack, Azariah ['1 Yonatan', '2 Rimona'] 45 
Azariah thought pic- ture hung Yonatan Rimona’s room, dark, thirsty bird atop brick wall, surrounding murk, diagnoal shaft sunlight, flaming wound shaft inflicted sin- gle brick lower corner. So I’m invited back chat play music chess. She’ll make lot expects forgiven. Her baby girl died doesn’t even that. “He’s loudmouth, cheat, brown-nose, bullshit- ter,” said Yonatan Rimona, “and yet can’t help kind liking him. I’m going talk Udi ship- ments. I won’t late.” A thick night hung kibbutz. The air cold raw, biting wind flag. It’s funny thing, thought Rimona, smiling darkness. In days followed, Azariah ['1 Yonatan', '2 Udi'] 96 
Azariah Gitlin made still repairs. His energy knew bounds. He greased, tuned, tightened; took apart reassembled; changed dying batteries read- justed fanbelts; washed, waxed, polished. He undertook reorganize shed arranging work tools logical or- der, putting broad wooden board hang screw- drivers, wrenches, pliers according size, labeling drawers shelves, scrubbing filthy concrete floor detergents. He persuaded Yonatan rafters get rid spider webs birds’ nests underneath tin roof. He catalogued spare parts took full inventory. As crowning touch, clipped large, colored photograph rotund Minister Welfare illustrated weekly magazine taped wall. Every day on, plump-cheeked jovial, Dr. Yosef Burg would look men work, ['1 Gitlin', '2 Yonatan'] 101 
work, imparting self-satisfied bliss. Azariah arrived early morning dark blue work clothes slightly big stood waiting Yonatan keys shed. Invariably, Yonatan ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 21 
Yonatan would sleepy, grouchy, often teary-eyed, Azariah would try cheer story one old grandmasters, giants like Alekhine, Capablanca, Lasker, compared current aces Botvinnik Petrosian were, speak, abject nonentities. To sure, entire fund knowledge subject came chess journals Yonatan studied exhaustively lying bed. One evening Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 45 
Azariah made way Yolek Hava’s harangued eight o’clock nearly midnight cyclic nature Jewish destiny, recurrent pattern destruc- tion redemption, repeatedly referring ideas number articles Yolek Lifshitz La- bor Party monthly come across recreation hall. He also expounded place creative individual kib- butz society. Though knowledge limited fervor unbounded, manage come original enough thought make Yolek ['1 Yolek', '2 Lifshitz'] 55

If he’s lucky enough find good girl, something may come yet.” “He’s strange sad,” replied Hava. “If ask me, come good end. You big dis- coveries!” Azariah managed gamble away last two packs American cigarettes chance give gifts new- found friends. One night landed last room adjoining swimming pool, reintroduced Etan met two girls living Etan ['1 Azariah', '2 Etan'] 71 
Etan since onset win- ter, began talk citrus fruit. When claimed grapefruit simply cross orange lemon, Etan objected challenged bet. Azariah mediately appointed two girls judges, asked ver- dict, deferred without protest lack support, laying two packs cigarettes table. Before leaving, prom- ised bring relevant volume Encyclopaedia Britannica, intended prove fruit, perhaps tan- gerine, half lemon half orange all. From Etan ['1 Etan', '2 Azariah'] 61 
Etan R.’s went pay call Srulik, music man, played guitar good ten minutes, smiling blinking frantically like cat wants ears scratched. Indeed, cat succeeded, Srulik decided let try kibbutz chamber quintet. On Thursday visited Yonatan ['1 Srulik', '2 Yonatan'] 35 
Rimona return part coffee sugar given him. After all, getting supplies kibbutz commissary accordance Secretary Yolek’s instructions. He presented Rimona shade made lamp, pointing token gift. The next night guest lacturer executive committee national trade union spoke dining hall plight Soviet Jewry, reading large number crumbling old letters reached devious ways behind Iron Curtain. His audience composed almost exclusively older members kibbutz, younger ones, single excep- tion, found entertainment. Srulik ['1 Secretary', '2 Rimona'] 70

By time question period arrived, how- ever, Azariah either got grip change heart, asked question refused accept answer given continued query lecturer full- fledged argument broke out. In one way another, Azariah Gitlin considered odd people met heard oth- ers. “Yolek’s Spinoza,” frequently called behind back. High-school wits amended “Chimpanoza.” Etan ['1 Azariah', '2 Etan'] 69

There nothing dull him, provided, course, one time listen. Apart occasional smirk snide remark, one would dreamed hurting Azariah It took kinds.

She took poring little English book India depths karmic suffering heights astral purity. She borrowed Azariah, margins bore penciled comments agitated hand. Every evening, without fail, sat it.

Every puddle, every window pane, every strip metal glinted dazzled. The air buzzed flowed like honey. Figs, mulberries, pomegran- ates, almonds, arbors grapes stood bared ultimate leaflessness, huge droves birds flocking all. All morn- ing long clear wind blew sea, wafting salty smells.

Is you, Yoni? Who think was, Marlon Brando?” “Yoni,” said Rimona ['1 Yoni', '2 Rimona'] 151

Azariah darkly. “Bolognesi good person,” said Rimona. “And you, Azariah. And good day hike.” “That’s sure,” said Udi. “It’s damned nice day. The winter really overdid year.” “I don’t know that,” said Rimona. “About what?” “About winter already over.” “I wish you’d stop talking winter,” said Anat. “I rather hear scalping parties.” They walked silence Tia bolted bushes jumped Yonatan head slow down.

She ran hand cheek wet one, wiped forehead back it, took branches cupped palms. ‘‘Thank you,” said. ‘‘You’re kind. ” ‘‘It nothing,” said Azariah, grinning. ‘‘And there’s water neck too.

On hilltop, sky, backed blue clouds, stood ruins Sheikh Dahr, light slashing gaping windows like eviscerating sword, out-of-doors bright one side smashed, charred, homeless walls other. Rubble fallen roofs lay heaps. Here unsub- mitring grape vine run wild, clinging bared claws remnant standing stone wall. Above ravaged village rose shattered minaret.

Then, turned savagely Azariah, looking spiteful glee declaiming yet another asinine Russian proverbs someone called Ivan thinking cap. “Why don’t shut hell up, Chimpanoza! So won’t fire!

Rimona’s corduroy pants clung trim, nubile body snugly unobtrusively, neatly knotted shirt some- navel, baring bit flat stomach slim waist. It’s way lying, though Yonatan. Only cares? “You relax,” said Anat. “The food almost ready.” Butterflies frolicked around pine trees swatches light umbrae olives.

We’d lie beneath blankets lights-out children’s house grown-ups gone, scared admit scared smoky wind blowing east windows smell kindling dried goat shit Arabs burned fuel. You know Arab smoke smell. And dogs barking sometimes muezzin wailing away top mosque.” “Now too,” said Rimona hesitantly. “Now what?” “She’s right,” said Azariah. “You hear sort faraway wailing too. And don’t even gun.” “It’s Red Indians,” whooped Anat. “It’s wind,” said Rimona. “And I’m almost sure smoke fire, Azariah.” “There’s still chicken left,” said Anat. “Does anybody want it?

Close, speak, rhythms cosmos. We learn olives. We learn everything, hills, fields, mountains, sea, wadis, stars above. That’s idea. It’s Spinoza’s.

Tia finished gnawing leftover chicken bones. They buried garbage shook folded Arab Legion kaffiyeh. The girls plucked stubble other’s back. “Who hell’s crying?” snapped Yonatan blue, though one said word. “It’s goddamn allergy again. It starts whenever anything starts growing. Azariah I go live desert.” “Excuse me. I said nothing sort.” “Maybe Uncle Manuel, whatever hell name was.” “Let’s go!’’ said Azariah ['1 Yonatan', '2 Azariah'] 62 
Azariah down-to-earth manner. “My Uncle Manuel killed, we’re today hike, memorial service. C’mon, let’s go!.’’ The hikers split two groups. Anat Rimona went looking mushrooms woods, men Tia hill poke ruins village. In time Udi ['1 Rimona', '2 Tia'] 35

The fact is, ’ said Udi, “we don’t know might skulking around aren’t armed. He could dangerous.” “Who?” “That fellow. The escaped prisoner warned week ago. The strangler.’’ “Bolognesi?” “Fuck Bolognesi! Yoni, instead clearing out, maybe try taking him, huh?’’ “Knock off!” grumbled Yonatan. “We’re play cops robbers. Let’s pick girls head home. It’s time call day.” “Why not? Don’t forget, there’s three us one him. It’s cinch we’re smart. The main thing’s keep guessing. The bastard’s probably asleep mosque.” “If I may make suggestion.” “You may not! Calm go right back girls. How little action, Yoni?” “Why not?” said Yonatan shrug, though giving foot-stomping child. “I’ll make dash first,” volunteered Azariah. “No one’s dashing anywhere,” Udi coolly. “We’re armed. He may be. But doesn’t know we’re many us are. Azariah, listen carefully. Don’t budge here. Pick nice big rock—that one do—and wait corner behind wall. Don’t make sound. If comes running direction, wait till he’s past brain one. Is clear?” “Fantastic!” “Yoni. Take dog cut retreat side hill. I’ll sneak beside door holler come hands like good boy. And get this.

We’re blood brothers, even blood spilled, what? Such love, life! If must die, die must. Enough, said Yonatan Enough. Who hell cares anyway? Far hillside, Anat Rimona ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 58

Yonatan shoulders Azariah, strove furtively match slow breathing own. Around them, weedy plants grew empty shell car- tridges. Copper coffee mugs shapes sizes, sooty black, silvery bright, stood shelves. An ancient nar- gileh adorned coffee table, charred helmet, branched wandering Jew.

And without looking recited breath, “He never tasted defeat never taste triumph’s sweet.” “That’s enough magic Chad,” said Yonatan. “Let’s go take nap. You rest place, Azariah. On couch. Rimona mind.

Why don’t play game chess.” With quick, precise movement, Rimona lightly brushed chill lips middle Azariah’s forehead. Azariah plate raced rain, stumbled, righted himself, splashed puddles, trampled bushes, sank mud, fought way reached Bolo- gnesi’s shack, found Tripolitanian snoring loudly beneath rough army blankets.

One evening told wife decided pick walk out. Life, said, must go on; suppose I killed. He first waited rain stop, political tension ['1 Rimona', '2 Yonatan'] 160

Yonatan thought, what? I’ll soon gone. Besides, Rimona’s exactly woman, he’s poor homeless guy. He plays guitar lit- tle chess, even usually loses. He takes care Tia then. He helps Rimona house every week dishes. What hell! As soon winter I’m old self again, I beat crap I feel like it. In meantime, let be. As poor jerk said one Russian proverbs his, even broken clock right twice day. At Lifshitzes’ music sometimes went late ['1 Tia', '2 Rimona'] 75

Yolek ['1 Yolek', '2 Lifshitz'] 140 
Yolek waited saw falling star. And begged mercy. Tia lay sprawled beneath couch hairy tail stick- ing out, thumping rug. The heavy brown cur- tains hid window door leading porch. All peace. The heater lit, reading lamp head couch. The overhead light off. “Hey, Azariah. Tell something. What’s book you’ve reading evening?” “The letters. In English. It’s philosophy book.” “The letters. To whom?” “All kinds people. Letters Spinoza “Okay. Get back it. I didn’t mean disturb you.” “You’re disturbing me, Yoni. Not all. I thought you’d dozed off.” “Who, me? Some chance. That’s something I work, you’re performing miracles tractors. Just I thinking knight. I’ve got simple solution.” ['1 Tia', '2 Spinoza'] 108 
That's it. What say English book?” I already told you, Yoni. It’s book Spinoza’s letters. With ideas. All sorts theories hypotheses. The kind stuff can't stand. About God, instance, nature His being, errors made human beings af- fections. By means feelings passions. Things like that.” “Just like Bolognesi.

At moment busy knitting red shawl Anat Shneour Spanish style. The needles flew hands. The heater crackled floor. In low, monotonous tones droned on, “I moan’a make’a complaint.

Thunderclap followed thunderclap, ['1 Bolognesi', '2 Shneour'] 135 
thunderclap, mighty tank battle fought another world. Bolognesi rose seat. With steps dainty Dresden china, went window prim fists beat fran- tically pane. At ten minutes two morning, Yonatan troubled sleep. A bloody, faceless corpse brought tractor shed army stretcher. It’s father, buddy, corps commander said, tapping Yonatan ['1 Bolognesi', '2 Yonatan'] 48 
Yonatan shoulder. He’s hacked death dagger two-legged beasts. But father sick old man, protested Yonatan, trying talk bargain way truth. Your father butchered biblical cruelty, barked corps commander. Instead standing answering back, don’t get ass try patch together. The words “biblical cruelty” struck Yonatan frothlike fury, spat disgust. He shrank back, mur- muring, okay, okay, dad, don’t annoyed, know I’m best. The prostrate Yolek plea. His voice rang like gong. You evil seed! You generation vipers! You degenerate race Tatars! You counterattack retake Sheikh Dahr hour regardless losses. You’ve got get thick skulls life-and-death battle. If lose, entire Jewish people die like dogs. But do, boys must see time take whole wicked world us. Remember, we’re counting you. I’m sorry say this, dad, said Yona- tan, aren’t dead? At that, bloody, faceless corpse leaped stretcher advanced Yonatan ['1 Yonatan', '2 Yolek'] 137 
Yonatan arms open embrace him. Dressed undershorts gray T-shirt, Yonatan rose start living-room couch sleeping on. His head weighed ton. He gasped breath cigarettes smoked. Once, movie, seen condemned men led cells scaffold middle night. Now, frozen half-awake, felt almost without regret time come. He went bathroom barefoot missed bowl, wetting seat floor around it. Idiot! thought, got drink whisky blab head off? And hell end sleeping like stiff couch? Through open bedroom door, bathroom light, could see Rimona ['1 Yonatan', '2 barefoot'] 79

His flesh crawled shuddered, trying fight memory free-for-all big double bed hours ago. The sweat, sordidness, anger, relentless sperm, shout torn chest, boyish sobs, soft beating fists, silent submission woman, like earth giving way plow. A wave burning revulsion.

We haven’t done bad job. And extent truly made better people ourselves. But really know ourselves? Nothing. Now, verge old age, I understand even less I thought I understood I young.

When comes selves know less sci- entists secrets nature, beginnings cosmos, origins life. Which nothing all. One Saturday, I happened lunch duty Rimona Lifshitz, serving food I drinks, I asked sheer politeness whether wasn’t finding hard going perhaps might need help. To replied lovely, inscrutable smile I shouldn’t feel sad everything looking up. Those words almost like touch warm hand. Some say she’s unusual girl. Others think phlegmatic far worse. For part, ever since Sat- urday, I made unwritten rule give little smile time meet. And now, early morning, Yonatan without word, leaving task finding deciding done. Where start looking him?

"I get it, whispered. “You’ve got heart murderer treat like this.” I understand murderer—her husband, son, or--- I put hand shoulder called softly name. “Srulik,” said, looking me, “will help?” “Of course I will,” I said. And though, many years now, physical contact anyone difficult me, I left hand was. I may even touched hair. I wouldn’t swear it, I think I did.

On way I stopped infirmary asked nurse look Yolek stay I arrived. People kept stopping give advice, ask latest news, spout kinds wild stories. I told I sorry I time.

But I’d better turn record, definitely night Brahms still Brahms. And comes next? Oh yes. Rimona, I found her, re- membered got back last night serving re- freshments members Jewish philosophy group (“When that?” “Late.” “Yes, when?” “About three-quarters way rain”), found two awake. A little tired though. Kind other, “like two little boys fought made up.” They kind too. And went bed. As she. (Whether kind well, I didn’t try guess. What I know?) “And Yoni leave?” “In night.” “Yes, when?” “Late. When to.” I asked happened morning. Azariah up. He thought he’d heard shooting. He wakes often think- ing hears shooting. Sometimes thinks hears, too. When saw Yoni ['1 Yoni', '2 Azariah'] 134 
Yoni gone, began run over. “Who did?” “Zaro. Yoni wouldn’t have. Yoni takes time. He never runs.” “What makes say that?” “Yoni tired.” In short, Azariah tractor shed, din- ing hall, over. And Rimona ['1 Yoni', '2 Azariah'] 34 
Rimona run- ning? She checked see Yoni taken left behind. He took always gets called army unit middle night. Because sometimes that’s come him. Why sure army hadn’t called last night too? I couldn’t get straight an- swer, “This time different.” What then? She sat waited. Then dressed, made bed, cleaned room. And didn’t go work laundry. And gave Tia And waited more. What waiting for? She waiting seven-fifteen. Why seven-fifteen? Because that’s Hava ['1 Yoni', '2 Tia'] 74

Please try concentrate answer me. Because it’s important. Do guess Yoni now?” "He’s gone.” ‘‘He certainly is. But where?” ‘‘To look something.” “To look something?” A brief silence, followed smile, calm, autumnal smile, say two us knew things people never dreamed of. I smiled back said, “Rimona. Please. This serious.” “I’m thinking,” said. “What thinking?” “That left said would.” “But left where? Why?” “To wander,” said. “Perhaps.” In early 1940’s kibbutz made arrangement pair dentists, husband wife, Dr. Fogel ['1 Hava', '2 Yoni'] 112 
Fogel Dr. Fogel. They recently arrived Poland offered treat us lower rates. The two never learned Hebrew. Anyone dental problem made trip poorly equipped clinic town. Until wife killed accident husband contracted fatal disease. In return fixed annuity, agreed take child kibbutz. A sweet, self-absorbed little girl, neat orderly, although bit slow withdrawn. When reached draft age, Yonatan Lifshitz married her. Every cabinet minister party leader attended wedding, members Knesset. Afterwards began work laundry. And became pregnant. And ap- patently something went wrong. Now people talked her. I tried listen. What man like gossip. Or pretty girls. Or anyone’s psyche. “Rimona,” I said. “One question. And time needn’t answer, it’s personal nature. Did Yoni from, complain about, seem hurt way . . . ties Azariah ['1 Yonatan', '2 Yoni'] 125 
Azariah Gitlin?” She paused. “But like to.” “Like what?” “Suffer.” “I’m sorry. I don’t understand. Who likes suffer?” “These people. Not everyone. Some do. Hunters spear antelopes do.” “I’m afraid beyond me. Who likes suffer?” “Yoni. And Zaro. And father too. And Bach. And Yolek well. Lots them.” Then strange smile reappeared, added, “Not you.” “All right. Let be. But suggest now?” “Whatever done. “Like what?” She couldn’t answer. “Should wait?’’ “Wait.” “Or look him?” “Look him. Because Yoni likes danger.” “Rimona. I need straight answer. Should wait look him?” “Look wait.” One last thing: Did need anything? Any help kibbutz? The question seemed confuse her. Any help? Oh, yes. Perhaps I could see Zaro picked on, though always asked it. Just make leave. He good. “Tell me, Rimona, going right now? “To see he’s breakfast. And make sure does, morning long he’s looking ['1 Yolek', '2 Yoni'] 144 
looking Yoni. He even went Sheikh Dahr, he’ll back soon. Then, I know. Maybe laundry. Maybe not.” I finally found Azariah sitting empty recreation hall. I must given start. He sorry, simply couldn’t go work tractor shed today. I word honor tomorrow next day would work overtime make it. He already looked everywhere kib- butz, orchards, far ruins Sheikh Dahr, trace. Now wanted die blame everything. “Srulik, maybe get Little Shimon, charge exterminating stray dogs around here, done me. Only let find Yoni I’m one can. And lots more.

As heeding advice, laid head shoulder Azariah, sitting beside couch. “Enough this!” said Hava. “Turn radio.” Azariah’s eyes fell upon Yolek’s books, stood long rows shelves, photographs tucked among them.

He felt unforgettably tormented, Ozymandian majesty two old men never looked eye, sat facing like two fallen Prometheans, like ruins two an- cient castles whose darkest keeps secret life lingered old battles, exquisitely refined tortures, witchcraft foul play, nightjars, owls, bats.

Feel free speak mind, try beating bush little less.” “But Galilee run away, sir!” Azariah out. “The Galilee, Negev, rest. There’s going war. We’ll taken surprise, fallen upon pogrom. They’re already sharpening knives. That’s Yonatan ['1 Eshkol', '2 Azariah'] 113

I’ve warned Comrade Eshkol war way even win, beginning end. I’ve said I say. Now I’ll keep mouth shut.” “You know,” said Eshkol, “the boy may right. Down gut whole thing scares me, I don’t want win war. Ah well! A fat lot good we’ve done today. What say name was, young man?” “Gitlin. Gitlin, Azariah. And I pity us all.” “You do? Perhaps would good tell us we’re deserving pity?” A mischievous glint flashed behind Eshkol’s thick lenses. “Quite simply, sir, you’ll need pity get,” con- tinued Azariah, “because country surrounded sides bottomless pits hatred. And bottomless pits loneliness, one stand ['1 Comrade', '2 Eshkol'] 132

They make fun behind back. They say you’re   patsy, half-and-half, sell-out, nebbish, sissy, finagler. They talk like Nazis. Even using anti-Semitic lan- guage. A shylock. A hymie. A cheap Jew politician. That’s talk too. Don’t interrupt me, Comrade Yolek! You glad I haven’t told Eshkol say him. And I pity everyone hates well. There people kibbutz couldn’t die soon. Most Kibbutz Granot, even one two people room, call Yolek ['1 Comrade', '2 Eshkol'] 98

And along you’ve lied kowtowed to. No one loves anyone, sir, even kibbutz, more. It’s wonder Yoni cleared out. The one loves myself, Rimona loves Yoni.

After all, responsibility mine. Tomorrow I shall drag hospital whether likes not. What confused, troublesome turn events, say wildly grotesque one. But point fact, situations seem grotesque me, whereas nothing ever seems fantastic. Any- thing, I’m convinced, possible. There nothing human beings incapable of. Perhaps I try write happened, some- thing may yet become clear me. I’ll try, usual, straightforward possible. At 3:30 morning I woke sweat as- pirin I took Saturday night. My grippe gone, though I still felt weak dizzy. By light reading lamp I put bookmark Donald Griffin, fallen blanket beside me, put book night table, donned Bolognesi old sweater bathrobe, turned electric heater, sat moment thinking winter morn- ing Death may come I’m pulling trousers making bed.

Any emotional disturbance? Other problems? Did young man previous history disappearing? Where get weapon took him? Were reliable full-face photographs available? Did identi- fying marks? What wearing left? What exactly take him? Did known enemies? Could draw list names addresses friends, relatives, acquaintances might staying? Did passport? Did family abroad? I rose open window, letting biting draft air. Udi happened passing outside, I asked find Rimona office. By herself, I stressed. While waiting her, I tried answer questions best I could. The sergeant wrote everything I said. This strictly confidential,” said captain, ‘‘we received urgent phone call morning ministry defense. Mr. Eshkol’s military attache personally asked us go case. I take party’s father Knesset? A good friend important people?” ‘‘Thank you,” I said. “I’m sure would done every- thing possible case.” When Rimona ['1 Udi', '2 Rimona'] 162 
Rimona arrived, helped serve guests coffee, smiling incongruous, wistful smile nobody particular, dark eyes glowing, blond hair covered kerchief.

You objection asking questions?” Thank coming visit. And sympathy. It's Yonatan needs sympathy, away now. And Aza- tiah needs too.” "Who’s Azariah?” "Yoni’s friend. There three us.” "What mean, three you?” "We’re three friends.” "Please, Mrs. Lifshitz. Try keep answers point. That way help least bother you. "Everyone kind helpful. Srulik, you, Yakov.

He didn’t exactly know. He heard calling far away said go. And really to.” “When exactly tell this?” "In middle night once. When raining hard.

Azariah come, came. And stayed. We wait. We sad. And don’t sad either.” ‘‘But stated purpose departure? “He said: ‘I’m going place. “His place?” ‘‘I think might place.” ‘‘You think might what?” “A place that’s own.” “To sure.

Back today’s events. At ten o’clock I picked Hava sewing shop went see Yolek. Rimona ['1 Hava', '2 Rimona'] 75 
Azariah already there, sitting one end couch straw mat feet. In dimly lighted room, framed books, Yolek indeed looked gray eminence, veiled clouds cigarette smoke. Azariah away too. Had interrupted political argument? A discussion Spinoza? Azariah’s guitar lying left, couch desk. Had intending play? When saw us, Yolek’s eyes shone amusement. “Well, tsaddik, you, enjoying yourself?” “Enjoying?” “Your new job. How secretary kibbutz feeling today? Is everything control?” “Srulik,” interrupted Hava, “has brains human charity little finger whole world-famous head.” “Na. What say that? Now wife fallen love too. Ah, well. At least, thank God, he’s taken back. I promise he’ll soon wish hadn’t. In humble opinion, though, it’s excellent reason propose little toast. Rimon’ka, it’s ['1 Yolek', '2 Azariah'] 116

Azariah room ask look Yoni’s map box bring office, door opened walked Prime Minister. He entered without entourage, bit sheepish-looking, pon- derous, blue shirt sticking trousers, shoes spat- tered mud. He gripped Hava shoulders gave kiss forehead. Yolek tea and, without wait- ing answer, told Rimona ['1 Hava', '2 Yolek'] 46 
Rimona bring some. I amazed notice moisture, fact actual tear, Yolek’s hard little eyes. He, course, quick blame allergy. Mean- while, Hava dashed kitchen, took fancy white tablecloth began preparing hot cold drinks, fruit, cake, making use best china. I keep back little smile. It time Yolek ['1 Hava', '2 Yolek'] 47 
Eshkol joking ban- tering away. From corner I could see Azariah devouring guest glittering eyes. His mouth hung slightly open, adolescent peeking beneath woman’s dress. Once I smiled myself. And when, presumably jest, Eshkol Yolek ['1 Azariah', '2 Eshkol'] 35 
Yolek fistfight, I couldn’t resist offering move aside furniture provide proper ring box in. Everyone laughed except me. Incidentally, I liked Prime Minister first. He struck compassionate man. Not taking digs Yolek, digs, I’m sorry say, I enjoyed. At one point I tempted interrupt usual sermon duty incumbent us cause unnecessary pain. I managed, however, restrain myself. Which said Azariah Gitlin. When Prime Minister rose leave, Azariah astonished us breaking long, confused tirade. In vain Hava tried make desist. Yolek ['1 Azariah', '2 Hava'] 80 
Yolek Eshkol seemed secretly united taking strange pleasure it. They even, I thought, egged boy on, wanted make ass himself. I suddenly felt place teetotaler room full drunks. Was I man capable sympathy Azariah? Did Azariah’s contortions tickle funny bones? I didn’t understand it. In event, I lost sympathy Eshkol. All life I found men hard take. Their concealed hatreds, cunning, self-induced illnesses, endless recourse Yiddish quotes Bible. Even though years I’ve tried become one myself, deep I feel proud never succeeded. Azariah much better. He ran amuck old Russian saws, insults, prophecies. Finally, Eshkol ['1 Eshkol', '2 Azariah'] 95 
Eshkol promised extend possible help taken leave, Yolek plied Azariah even praised poor fellow insolence. Eventually another guest arrived, stout, dandyish person light flannel suit smartly trimmed Vandyke beard. He appearance worldly artist reeked much smug success expensive cologne. His toneless, slightly nasal voice faint American accent. He sounded pipe clenched teeth. The new arrival introduced brandishing gold- rimmed calling card announcing, “Arthur I. Seewald. United Enterprises. Which one gentlemen Mr. Lifshitz?” “Right here,” said Yolek ['1 Yolek', '2 Azariah'] 76 
Yolek hoarsely, banging brandy glass table. Arthur I. Seewald ignored unmistakable sign displeasure, handed Yolek card, sat without asked. He was, explained, Tel Aviv representative num- ber foreign business firms local agent Mr. Benjamin Bernard Trotsky Florida. In telex received Mr. Trotsky ['1 Yolek', '2 Trotsky'] 42 
custom. In case, considering ur- gency matter hand— “What matter?” asked Yolek, cutting short. His bris- tling unshaven cheeks, heavy frame wrapped blue robe red pajamas gave aspect Oriental despot. In- deed, glowering imperiousness contempt, seemed lift finger order newcomer beheaded. “Perhaps you’ll kind enough skip rest introduc- tion come point?” The point message secretary Kibbutz Granot arrived Mr. Trotsky’s desk three days ago. Was young man question still missing? "My son,” said Yolek, choking back anger, ‘‘would ap- pear gone join Mr. Trotsky. Psia krew. Is there? Yes no?” Mr. Seewald smiled pleasantly. According latest infor- mation hand, Mr. Trotsky still expecting hear young man and, indeed, rather concerned him. He even planned fly Israel yesterday morning, business matter and, all, possible arrival young Mr. Lifshitz cancel trip. The fact Bahamas reason sent telex fully au- thorizing Mr. Seewald negotiate name. Mr. Seewald himself, way, lawyer profession. ‘‘Negotiate what?” “Yoni’s alive!” gasped Hava. ‘‘He’s them! I’m telling you, Yolek, he’s already there. I want give whatever ask for, long comes back. Do hear me?” Mr. Seewald seemed momentarily loss. Could possibly minutes Mr. Lifshitz ['1 Trotsky', '2 Lifshitz'] 185 
afraid not, eh? This whole business be- ginning smell high heaven! What’s going here, con- spiracy? Blackmail? Gesheften? What’s rotten clown to?” With full weight behind him, spun around face Hava, turning purple, twisted vein pulsing forehead. “Exactly much, Mrs. Lifshitz, already know this? What hell redneck al- ready conspired Yonatan behind back? Rimona. Srulik. Azariah. Out. All you. No. Wait. Srulik here.” I stayed. On way out, Azariah ['1 Yonatan', '2 Srulik'] 69 
Azariah unsuccessfully tried conceal snicker. Rimona said, “Hava Yolek, please don’t fight. It makes Yoni Yolek ['1 Rimona', '2 Yoni'] 16

This isn’t social call.” “Oh, it’s not, it?” growled Yolek. “And I think- ing you’d come dancing party! All right, sir. I’m lis- tening. You begin. And way, I’ve nothing talking private. Hava, bedroom. Srulik, stay. I need witness. This whole thing stinks. Hava, I said out!” “Certainly not,” exploded Hava. ‘‘I don’t care burst gut. This house. It’s son he’s talking about. No one kicking out. Here’s glass water. And take pills.” Yolek roughly pushed away hand, sloshing water. He pulled cigarette pocket robe, fingered it, tapped arm chair, tapped end, studied length usual fashion. Finally, broad nostrils twitching, decided light turned me. “Srulik, perhaps I enlist good services. Do think charms might prevail lady kindly leave us alone while?” “It pleasure talk private afterwards, Mrs. Lifshitz,” Mr. Seewald offered amiably. Hava me. “Shall I, Srulik?” Her tone down- right docile. "I think should. But stay next room,” I said. "Ty zboju!" snarled Yolek ['1 Yolek', '2 Hava'] 182 
Yolek slammed door hard glasses tinkled table. From pocket, visitor produced long white envelope carefully folded piece paper. This power attorney telexed Mr. Trotsky. In envelope open ticket I instructed purchase.” ‘‘An open ticket? Who for?” "For lady. Tel Aviv—New York—Miami. Round trip, course. Tomorrow she’ll passport visa. Mr. Tro- tsky's name great simplifier procedures number countries.” Yolek removed glasses pocket, settled slope profligate nose, gave Mr. Seewald crafty side- ways glance, said, without looking papers put him, "Na.

In way, stated, potential misunderstanding unnecessary debate might avoided. I tried make inconspicuous possible turn- ing head window staring it. A blue sky. One two wisps light cloud.

Having finished formal deposition, lawyer con- tinued own. “I authorized negotiate mat- ter discreetly you, Mr. Lifshitz, separately wife, order reach understanding both. And I concrete proposal make.” “You do?” said Yolek trace annoyance, extend- ing head forward fearful failing hear. “A proposal?

Thank consideration.” Yolek kept thoughtfully silent, still gently fingering un- lighted cigarette. With due deliberation moved ashtray edge table center asked barely audible voice, ‘‘Did hear that, Srulik?” “Yes,” I replied. “Srulik, smell I smell?” “It would seem me,” observed Mr. Seewald politely, “that important consideration parties concerned welfare young man.” “Srulik, I say anything, I need un- qualified opinion. You judge. Is involved this? Is intrigue?” “Absolutely not,” I said. “Hava nothing it.” “On contrary!” said Mr. Seewald contentedly. “Although I’m sure Mrs. Lifshitz say least, highly pleased. If you’ll permit speak now, I can’t imagine take long.” “I’ll permit you, ['1 Yolek', '2 Lifshitz'] 120

With cumbersome movement, reached out, gathered telex, ticket, page Mr. Seewald read from, tore shreds, piled neatly one end table. “Now get here,” said, himself. “Mr. Lifshitz!” “Get here. The door right behind you.” Mr. Seewald turned pale crimson. He rose, snatched leather briefcase, pressed chest feared might go way documents. “Damnation,’’ swore Yolek. “Listen here, tell mas- ter there—” Just then, however, Hava bedroom, flew them, came halt facing me. “Srulik, he’s slaughtering child! For love God, let it. He slaughtered Yoni ['1 Yolek', '2 Hava'] 102

She already thrown sobbing straw mat Yolek’s feet. “Have pity child, monster! On child!

Srulik, quick, run him, promise whatever want. Eshkol help. Give anything, get boy back. Srulik!” “Don’t dare!” said Yolek voice. “I for- bid go him. Can’t see she’s sick woman?” By Mr. Seewald already left. I hesitated fol- lowing out, catching limousine. He paused remarked coldly nothing say prepared regard party negotiations. I negotiate, Mr. Seewald,” I said. “But I message convey. Please tell Mr. Trotsky ['1 Eshkol', '2 Yolek'] 147

You also inform Mr. Trotsky keeping anything back us, pressuring Yonatan, monkey business, kibbutz fight way. And more, shall win. Please tell exactly I’ve said.” Without waiting answer offering shake hands, I hurried back Lifshitzes. Somehow, strength one discovers emergencies, Hava ['1 Yonatan', '2 Trotsky'] 82 
Hava single-handedly dragged Yolek couch run get doctor. Yolek’s face turned blue. His hands pressed chest. Scraps papers torn still clung robe. I brought drink water. His agony diminished savage will-power, however, warned whisper, “If made deal him, I’ll make live regret it.’’ “Calm down. I didn’t make deals. And don’t try talk now.

Yolek gripping couch packing-crate hands really dragged away brute force, contemptuously bitter look ugly face. There something quite horrid him, yet time—why deny it?—something positively majestic I admired envied heart. “He go hospital,” said doctor. “Yolek staying here,” I heard say. ‘‘That’s wish, hut driver duty night long.” I set arrange matter Etan ['1 Yolek', '2 Etan'] 84

Although, I’ve said, touching woman is, personal rea- sons, hard me, I put arm around shoulders. From path outside I called back doctor, “We’ll office. And afterwards place. After found Etan I told go sit night pickup truck Yolek’s apartment, Hava spoke up, meekly. “You’re angry me, Srulik.” "Not angry. Just concerned. "I'll right.” “I want go place rest.

And you’re well either.” “I’m fine,” I said. At office, Udi Shneour waiting seemed important piece information. Despite Azariah’s protests, gone Rimona’s apartment I instructed, searched closets, found Yoni’s set maps, which, seemed, whole triangle Negev Sodom Rafiah Eilat missing. I told get hold Chupka let know this, even took night. Meanwhile, I used one phone, infirmary, call Prime Minister’s personal secretary home give addresses phone numbers Seewald Trotsky.

I walked end, lighting way little pocket flashlight I took morning Yolek’s desk. What’s favorite expression his? Mea culpa. I expropriated flash- light. No good come Dostoyevskyizing, said Eshkol.

R. sound asleep wheel pickup truck, I told be. No, I see mistakes arrangements I made today. I not, however, enter last shack. Some inner discom- fort held back. Through curtainless window, light bare yellow bulb, I see Bolognesi, however, head wrapped cloth hid rotten ear, woolen blanket around him, sitting erect bed, knitting needles clicking away, rocking rhythmically back forth, lips moving. We stood minutes, dog I, sniffing night breeze. Had Rimona promised winter spring way? Some day, memory, I’ll ask Hava ['1 Rimona', '2 Hava'] 83

What better time now, Hava installed apartment I new secretary kibbutz? Just I saw headlights car square front dining hall. I hurried, almost ran, there, Tia front me. An army vehicle. The slam door.

In fact, I urge go back stroll more, perhaps even join Stutchnik help night milking I used twenty years ago. We could harmonize baritones old poem Bialik’s Tshernichovsky’s set music. Anything avoid talking, talked enough. Yes, that’s exactly I’m going do. I’m going make rounds more. It’s long, complicated day, knows what’s store tomorrow. Tonight’s report done.

Thanks drink, rest it. Just let go now,” said Yonatan firmness could muster. “I’ve really got get going.” “All right, malchik, let’s go.” “What?” “You wanted go, didn’t you? Come on, then.

I never even asked Syrian gynecologist Haifa body. What stillborn? Store ghost town mountains? In special hideaways cut stone? Deep valley shadow death? Rimona’s Efrat must there. My daughter? Am I father? How scary, word “father.” Me? And could I recognize child I’ve never seen? Among many children? If I called name loud—Efrat!—would come give hug? He wiped brow back hand slightly loosened shoulder straps. She used put hand belly feel baby move, peer I really cared. Me? A father? Efrat’s? The baby’s too? When abortion? Madness! Mysteriously, Yonatan sensation baby moving belly. Just then, soles boots made crunch- ing sound. Clearly, walking gravel. Am I bed wadi? It wasn’t long feet could feel silent sand beneath them. Soon moon rise. That wadi I crossed minutes ago must Wadi Araba. That means I’m bor- der. Out Israel. In Kingdom Jordan, home cut- throat nomads. I’d better alert. How come I never cried her? How come, whenever Ri- mona wanted talk her, I told cut out? She child. How could I forgotten Rimona two years Efrat? Come on, I yelled her, it’s soon us children.

stood stock- still. His heart beat wildly. He slipped shut safety catch forced resume walking. Nothing worry about. I’m heading straight Wadi Musa. I’m afraid I don’t care. Not tired, hungry, thirsty. Efrat brave papa. And night begun. What's there? Who’s shining light me? Is enemy outpost? A Bedouin torch? It softly muted, otherworldly light. A slight shudder ran along ridge line, then, red, enflamed, huge, moon emerged behind Edomite range. In instant world transformed. Bright swaths moonlight streaked swarthy mountainsides. Ripples pale light eddied plain. Lifeless silver flowed silently lifeless earth. Here there, rock loomed. Fast walked, Yonatan could escape shad¬ owy specters split body, dancing ghastly shapes. They ghosts. The Syrians we’ve killed. The Arabs brother bayoneted. And Rimona white sheet, frozen smile marble face. My parents valley dead, head wrenched back, sunk chest, amidst ruins Sheikh Dahr, soaked dead pale silver. They dead. I alive. I’ve murdered all. He fell face parched, salty ground. What done, madman, done, it’s death. He grabbed rifle, released safety catch, squeezed trig- ger hard could, whimpering like dog. The butt kicked back him. The smell gunpowder turned stom- ach. The long volley merged pounding heart. The desert wadi walls ['1 Yonatan', '2 Rimona'] 198

In courtyards Arab village bougainvillea blazed stones, wild grape vines inched tendrils smashed archways, acacia trees spread fragrance thick thieves. In wagon hitched trac- tor, Udi hauled away ruins large grindstone, stone lintel, blackened threshing sled, displayed prominently garden.

Rimona large, cracked pottery jar. He planted red geranium placed front home. “Yoni like lot,” said. In voice heard neither joy sadness. Every morning four Little Shimon took sheep pasture hills east. And day Etan R. cut wagonload alfalfa scatter among feedstalls cowshed. In afternoon, communal chores finished, members kibbutz began tend little gardens, hoeing, pruning, mowing. The news radio continued re- port tension northern border, infiltrators, imminent danger war, vigorous protests warnings lodged Prime Minister Eshkol Four Powers. Some- times, one news bulletin next, old Hebrew song tugged heartstrings. Life went on. Except mid-April Stutchnik suddenly died. One morning, way back night milking, entered Srulik's office boots, trailing barnyard smell, shyly asked permission send telegram. To daughter Kiryat Gat come bring husband children her. When asked happy occasion was, Stutchnik turned pale leaned ['1 Etan', '2 Eshkol'] 134 
since return hospital, Yolek sat deck chair fig tree near porch. For hours end, arms resting limply sides chair, would watch magic spring, first time life. On small stool beside lay pile newspapers magazines, open book, face down, closed book, reading glasses. None seemed hold interest. Only sights scents springtime appeared touch him. If small boy pursuit ball approached, Yolek would nod twice trying puzzle difficult problem, pronounce, “A boy.” If Hava bearing medicine glass water, sub- mitted. “Shoyn. Everything fine now,” would say. If kibbutz secretary came sit dusk, tell problems solutions, Yolek ['1 Yolek', '2 Hava'] 94 
Yolek would remark, “Really, Srulik, it’s simple.” Or, “Vus brennt?" No thunder lightning, mea culpas, biblical rage. The doctor found condition stable. He be- come obedient, tractable patient. When Rimona came see him, always bearing myrtle branch oleander blossom, would lay broad, ugly hand head say, “Thank you. Nice. You’re saint.” More often not, flowers would remain lap evening. His hearing grown worse, almost point deaf- ness. Even low-flying jet planes savagely crisscrossing sky failed make look up. After consulting Hava, doctor, nurse, Srulik latest-model hearing aid. Meanwhile rested Tia ['1 Rimona', '2 Srulik'] 90 
Tia drowsing feet, longer bothering chase away flies. Every weekend Amos came home leave. One Saturday turned ladder, paint, brush paint parents’ kitchenette. Hava presented small transistor radio. Azariah wheelbarrow full concrete patched cracks pavement stairs Yolek ['1 Hava', '2 Azariah'] 37 
Yolek wouldn’t stumble. On Saturday nights drank coffee together listened sports roundup. Once, amazement all, Amos picked Azariah’s guitar managed play three sim- ple tunes. Where could learned that? And yet another little wonder: Bolognesi appeared one day blue woolen wrap knit protect Yolek’s knees evening chill. Hava two bottles brandy left house, one full one half empty. Since return hospital, Yolek ['1 Bolognesi', '2 Hava'] 62 
take responsibility deciding whether pregnancy continued. Perhaps would turn well all. Srulik heard Hava, insisted right duty go Rimona hear say, Rimona ['1 Srulik', '2 Rimona'] 22 
Rimona hopelessly distracted. Each day, came back work laundry, Rimona found marble counter kitchen oranges, grapefruit, jars honey, dates, fresh cream Hava house. Once, finding record Mississippi blues instead, recalled Yonatan’s birthday. Every Thursday, Rimona ['1 Rimona', '2 Hava'] 35 
Rimona baked Hava Yolek Amos’s weekend visit. Sometimes, Saturday night, Major Chupka dropped by. He would sit family, Yolek, Hava, Rimona, Azariah, Amos, drink cup coffee, put away sandwiches, say little. Yonatan ['1 Hava', '2 Yolek'] 32 
They found sleeping like baby sheikh’s abandoned house, tied hands behind back shirt, marched Afula police station. There, vig- orous questioning, Captain Bechor finally satisfied client never encountered Yonatan Lifshitz.

From time time, too, confessed, supplied fresh clothes, matches, even bottle arak Bolognesi, come know prison many years before. If you’d like, said Be- chor, give crackpot third degree well. No, thank you, said Srulik. Don’t bother. Bolognesi Leave alone. The tractor shed run Azariah ['1 Yonatan', '2 Bolognesi'] 89 
Azariah Gitlin. He hired hand help him. It taken Srulik’s influence get young mechanic’s candidacy membership approved general meeting, since time, Azariah’s garrulousness somewhat diminished. Only rarely would inform Yashek Little Shimon breakfast embarrassment like bad comparison remind Etan R.

There cheerfully hoed, raked, pruned, mowed, fertilized chemically organically, planted everything cactuses carnations, decorated fences various gears, pistons, pieces junk taken discard pile tractor shed. Every day breakfast, returning work, Azariah would sit ten minutes Yolek tree, reading aloud headline news morning paper. Yolek ['1 Azariah', '2 Yolek'] 48 
Yolek didn’t hear word, since loathed new hearing aid re- fused wear it. Laying large, leathery hand back Azariah’s, might ask, trace wonder, “Eh? What that? What’s new?” Or declare sadly, “Berl old fox him- self.” Or else, “No question it, Stalin never liked us.” Azariah would straighten Yolek’s knit woolen knee wrap be- fore returning tractor shed. He saw vet visited kibbutz every two weeks gave Tia injec- tion, reconditioned painted old wheelchair case Yolek ['1 Azariah', '2 Tia'] 76 
Yolek need it, accompanied Rimona Haifa buy maternity clothes. On occasion bought little En- glish book India reincarnation way inner peace. He worked hard tractor shed ran well. By time barley harvest hand, combines ready freshly cleaned painted till gleamed. During first week May Azariah brief letter Prime Minister, assuring Comrade ['1 Rimona', '2 Azariah'] 51 
Comrade Eshkol that, despite ridicule ugly jokes expense, many common people loved him. Eshkol responded immediately hand ordinary postcard. “Thank you, young man,” said. “You bolstered spirits greatly. Do forget pay respects Yolek All best.” Srulik ['1 Eshkol', '2 Yolek'] 36 
Srulik continued play flute whenever time, night. Hava long since moved rooms ceased burden, day long but- tonholed paths kibbutz, dropped office, people problems requests. Would please use influence help get job? Would please good take stand economic educational issue? He made little notebook jot petition, crossing one one dealt with. Not night came ever time writing music. Yet wonders cease.

Even young son Amos informed planned marry girlfriend fall made mind leave kibbutz join professional army, Yolek’s response “Shoyn. Fine. Never mind.” A letter Trotsky arrived one day. It addressed Yolek new secretary. He sorry say still heard son. In vain waited, still refused give hope. And never would. Why he? His brother vanished twenty years ago, yet despaired either. All things possible. Would Srulik ['1 Trotsky', '2 Yolek'] 95 
Srulik agree behalf kibbutz accept donation con- struction music room? Or perhaps library lecture hall? He beseeched secretary turn down. He lonely man, longer young. God knew many years left. And Kibbutz Granot, spite everything, spent best days life fathered child. Srulik wrote back without delay: “Thank offer. In two three weeks I bring steering com- mittee. I favor.” Azariah away kerosene heater storage space shower taken electric fan, spring already given way summer. On top shelf bookcase neatly arranged Yonatan’s chess books. On bot- tom shelf, alphabetical order, arranged Rimona’s books Africa. At ten-thirty double bed turned sleep, Ri- mona sat easy chair, sleeveless blue summer house frock revealed pregnant state. Her hands lay lap. A subdued light eyes. What might see among folds brown curtain? Perhaps forms music issued record spinning turntable—not The Magic Chad, Mississippi blues given Hava, ['1 Srulik', '2 Azariah'] 141 
Hava, Bach violin concerto. Azariah could scarcely take eyes her, stom- ach swelling beneath small breasts, thin knees parted slightly blue frock, blond hair falling shoul¬ ders, left one bit right. The radiance face enveloped like fragrance. She longer copied African charms little index cards. She longer shaved light fuzz arms either. What waiting for? For cake baking kitchen? For Azariah perhaps? Almost manly-looking now, homely before, sat quietly pondering chess problem little board Yonatan olive wood. The board set pieces: black king queen, black rook black knight, two black pawns, white king queen, two white rooks, one white pawn. He taking time. All ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 104 
All still house except sound turtle scratching away cardboard box porch. Once Azariah secret name him, Little John. Now simply called The Turtle. Once played chess intuitively, gambling wild inspirations. Now studied systematically books journals Yonatan behind. Once relied tractor shed knowledge mechanics acquired army workshops. Now pored maintenance manuals Ferguson, John Deere, Massey-Harris. Once chain- smoked table across Yonatan. Now cut down, read newspaper smoke harmful pregnant women could even endanger baby womb.

She laid hand forehead, responded touching shoulder. Rimona, sit down.” Next you, explain something chess me? Or I before?” “Next me.” “You’re good.” “What I done?” “You took lettuce.’’ “I did? Who? What lettuce?” “The turtle. And fixed faucet.” “Because drip getting nerves. I put new washer in.” “I’ll bring tea soon there’ll cake. I’ll tea too. Not hot tea, though. Cold.” “Incidentally, I happen something drink. With Etan volunteers. Did know he’s got new one? Brigitte, remember her, gone. Now there’s Diana. But Smadar still there.” “That’s true,” said Rimona “What isn’t?” “Incidentally. Once explained nothing incidental. You said Spinoza ['1 Etan', '2 Rimona'] 133 
Spinoza discovered that. And told us teacher, Yehoshafat. I believed you, made Yoni sad.” Azariah white rook board, replaced knight, shook head. “You remember everything, don’t you? You never forget thing.” They lapsed silence. The violin concerto concluded diminuendos resignation. The cake done. Rimona ['1 Yoni', '2 Azariah'] 44 
Rimona sliced served it, poured cold tea. ‘ I dreamed Yoni last night,” said. “That army barracks playing guitar. You could see dream liked it, soldiers too. You also there, knitting sweater.” Although cold weather long gone, Rimona pulled hands back sleeves, still gripped glass cold tea hands trying warm herself. The floor gave subtly clean smell. Azariah ['1 Yoni', '2 Rimona'] 58 
Azariah absentmind- edly shifted gaze bookcase side room. The framed gray snapshot Rimona Yoni moon Judean Desert caught eyes, squashed jerrycan sand them, behind back jeep. It’s odd thing, thought, I never noticed there’s someone else photograph, hairy leg shorts paratrooper boots. "He ten twenty children, poor man. He played organ church earn much. Mrs. Bach time children. Surely help washing cooking, borrow money buy coal, since always winter Germany. It hard him, yet sometimes exudes joy.” ‘‘I’ve one since I child,” said Azariah. Rimona ['1 Rimona', '2 Yoni'] 85 
Rimona asked whether turn radio eleven o’clock news. Forget it, said Azariah. ‘‘They talk endlessly, realizing verge war. Everything points it: Rus- sians, arms race, impression Eshkol weak sheepish tired.” He good,” said Rimona. Eshkol? Yes, is, though even someone like reads situation better does. Only I’ve decided keep mouth shut. What I say always makes laugh.” Wait, said Rimona, wait, Zaro, time pass, grow start listening. Don’t sad.” Who's sad? Azariah ‘‘I not. Just little tired four. Let’s go sleep.” In bed, glow radio, playing late-night music, kissed tenderly times. The doctor Haifa advised since pregnancy routine one, must refrain completed sex. She moistened palms saliva began stroking Azariah’s penis them. Almost sperm jetted upon fingers, buried high, sharp cry hair. Once peace, kissed corners ['1 Eshkol', '2 Azariah'] 126 
corners eyes. By time returned bathroom, already sleeping like child. She turned radio lay wide awake beside him, listening peacefully earth Efrat breathing dark. As soon Efrat fallen asleep, too. Much later, near midnight, Srulik passed nocturnal stroll. He turned sprinkler Azariah tend lawn. By four, Azariah ['1 Srulik', '2 Azariah'] 47 
Azariah bed work tractor shed. After changing radiator D-6 fixing oil leak one combines, occurred remove picture Minister Welfare clipped illustrated magazine winter. In place Dr. Burg, put colorful picture sea, much mind summer heat grew intense. Rimona work laundry room two hours later. So how's everything? asked Hava. “Are sure you’re right. Nothing hurts? Just remember you’re carry any- thing.” I made pot orange marmalade yesterday,” said Ri- mona. “Please don’t forget look it. I left marble counter kitchen.” In metal shop barefoot ['1 Rimona', '2 barefoot'] 84 
Bolognesi donned welder’s mask set work repairing chicken cages. Sparks flew direc- tions. “By day’a drought consume’a an’ frost night,” mumbled. Etan R. made far-reaching changes cowshed. Now stubborn Stutchnik gone last one stand way progress, lost time streamlining operation. Both girlfriends worked alongside him, lunacy late-night milking relegated dust- bin history. The three began milking eminently civilized hour nine p.m. On finishing around twelve, would go starlit dip pool, open bottle wine, let nature take course. Finally yielding suasion, Yashek agreed take Sru- lik’s old job bookkeeper. Since off-season citrus groves, Udi ['1 Etan', '2 Udi'] 93 
Shneour working grain fields, swearing would straighten mess come hell high water. His wife Anat due December. From time time two would Azariah Ri- mona, also expected give birth early winter, Turkish coffee cardamom. Udi enjoyed talking past future wars. Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Udi'] 41 
Azariah penchant politics—Nas- ser’s trouble Yemen, dilemmas facing King Hussein, blindness Eshkol cabinet—and dark labyrinths Russian soul. Azariah object snickers behind back. He learned art pausing effect be- tween one sentence next making people laugh wanted to. He also mastered trick interrupt- ing unexpected rhetorical question, uncon¬ ventionality tended make audience feel considering subject without prejudice first time. Azariah ['1 Eshkol', '2 Azariah'] 59 
Azariah long since given strutting cuffed ga- bardine slacks, haunting high-school girls’ dorm, boasting telepathic telekinetic powers, exasperating Srulik feverish confessions undying love. Upon leaving dining hall supper would put arm around Rimona’s waist, green eyes glinting unspoken arrogance male taken another male’s female might time wants. At last could see really was. And seen nothing yet. The day would come historians would recall Yolek every child land would know Kibbutz Granot home Azariah ['1 Srulik', '2 Yolek'] 74 
Azariah Gitlin. Gitlin? Shouldn’t perhaps adopt Hebrew-sounding name, like Gat Geytal? These days consistently high spirits. After putting fourteen hours tractor shed, still managed find time Rimona, socialize, help Hava, play guitar, chat Srulik, bone professional liter- ature, improve chess, keep world national affairs, crack book poetry, even, then, take yet another peek Spinoza. Azariah grown tan. The summer sun singed light head hair, grown longer since arrival last win- ter, short hedgehog’s. A scar chin cour- tesy red-hot engine oil given no-nonsense look. Come August, promised himself, would learn swim take driving lessons. He even become source comfort others. One day, tears eyes, Anat accosted tractor shed begged private talk. Azariah took aside spot behind hayloft where, many years previously, maniac fired revolver everything sight. She could go liv- ing like longer, said. Udi animal. Now pregnant spending every night Etan ['1 Azariah', '2 Udi'] 142 
Etan two whores swimming pool coming home three morning. Azariah recalled tearful young woman taken cold-blooded pleasure teasing him, making play peekaboo hem dress neckline, driving half mind foul torments lust. He put hand gently nape neck, overcame momentary hesitation, reminded this. Not letting flustered blushes, proceeded speak recalcitrance flesh, different men, far removed times emotion, piercing, almost like pain. He tried explain Udi partly child boastful war stories, bravado killing death, deliberate coarseness came inner fear tender soft. When Anat’s eyes overflowed begged tell do—look way? quarrel? move out?—Azariah said, Anat, know frightened, try help be, don’t ask how, one knows him. She went crying least ten minutes ['1 Azariah', '2 Udi'] 109 
minutes Azariah stood there, holding arm felt better. Now would chat Hava often talking childhood. For reason felt need tell things never able, wanted, disclose Yoni, Yolek, Srulik, even Rimona. About hungry years run forests, villages, snows Russia, freight trains way across Urals, filthy cities Asia sweltering steppes. About par- ents. About horrid old aunt tyrannized went mind immigrants’ camp Israel. About years army failed break him, though humiliated picked on, time little believed mission. And win¬ ter night arrived, Yolek ['1 Azariah', '2 Hava'] 81 
Yolek caring toward him, you, Hava, took first time dining hall, Yoni came take work next morning. It made Yoni angry told choice, angry nothing ever happened here, one day like next. He used talk setting Bangkok Karachi, places like that, couldn’t believe I happy stay put live one place. He even laughed way almost hit me, brothers same. Whenever asked thought Yonatan Azariah ['1 Yoni', '2 Yonatan'] 64 
Azariah could tell Yoni unhappy gone away perhaps punish everybody else. “Oh, talk, right,” Hava say, wistfulness malice, pour cold soda drink. One evening asked play something guitar them, would make Yolek ['1 Yoni', '2 Hava'] 32 
Yolek happy. Azariah complied haunting melody Tshernichovsky’s “Play, Play Upon My Dreams,” Yolek sign hearing note. Later, Srulik ['1 Azariah', '2 Yolek'] 18 
Srulik dropped say good evening, two men left together, asked Azariah serve instructor summer work camp city youth. Although Azariah thrilled, protested much work already forced Srulik good five minutes convince him. That evening, found broken old fan Etan ['1 Azariah', '2 Srulik'] 39 
To quote Bolognesi, Bless’a name Lord Who grant’a perfect peace. But perfect peace. Time takes us apart take away traces us. As waters cover sea. Would dif- ferent I loved woman? Had I children grandchildren? The waters would covered sea same. I seized fear trembling. What exactly it, then, happening me? All sudden, brink old age, I begun crave smidgeon power honor. Not crave them, get them, absurd may sound. Why, better example could Yolek, man sated honor power. How I envied life, I longed witness downfall, suffering, anguish, even death, I could take place. Why, though? To loved? But Yolek loved. Eshkol Who is? And Bialik, one poems, asks love is. Well, record let answer. My dear poet, you’ll forgive me, I don’t know either. It's rumor. A fleeting shadow. A will-o’-the-wisp. Is Yoni ['1 Yolek', '2 Eshkol'] 135 
Yoni went look God-knows-where? What Azariah came seek? Is thing all? I can’t help smiling I write this—a man age position mewling like schoolboy whether love exists. And yet I insist asking, not? And does, possibly things contradict it? I could take, example, father son. Or two brothers. Or husband wife. All them, like carriers mysterious virus, harboring particular lone- liness, particular estrangement, particular pain, dark desires inflict pain others. Or inflict pain, use others. To change them. To mold them. To dominate them. To reshape whomever love like lump putty hands. As waters cover sea. If I son daughter own—a Rimona, say, Yoni would ['1 Azariah', '2 Yoni'] 105 
yet pain well suffer it. What infernal verse Genesis: “Sin lieth door, unto thee shall desire, thou shalt rule him.” Perhaps means: To take pain. To inflict it. To pity. To inflict yet pity more. To another self. Unto pain shall thy desire, thou shalt rule it. Rule over? Horribly enough, monstrous shadow already ensconced heart nobly sensible commandment, tainted exhortation rule. What mean, rule? What, suppress? To put down. To crush. And pity set free, were, crush subtly. To rule? Over pain? While pain rule? What farce is. What crude joke played us. So banal vulgar, repetitious. What saying Azariah fond of? “Only man gone defeat knows taste triumph sweet.” Defeat? Triumph? No, thank you. All I ask know pain lessened, even slightly, even time. Through solitude? Asceticism? Language? Or, contrary, mindless ecstasy, sensual riot, turning deaf ear everything clamor blood? How dearly I would like know answer. Matthews calls “purposeless navigation,” because, opinion, biological value, func- tion simply known us. And Yolek right. As always. This impossibly self- indulgent man saw right away bizarre, suspicious- looking, hysterically garrulous boy turned one winter night something special needed cultivated, might accomplish great things one day even prove blessing us all. ['1 Azariah', '2 Yolek'] 200 
all. Only Yolek detect it? Hon- esty compels admit me, I secretary time, I would probably sent Azariah back night, whether caution, narrow- mindedness, inner equivalent shrug, simple disinclination stick neck out. What magical power made Yolek, way, Rimona, perhaps totally different way, adopt Azariah? I wish I knew. But I don’t. I sorry. I’ll stop it’s late. The agricultural season height. The days long hot nights short. No breeze. Harvesting done three shifts, night too, floodlights. Soon fruit pick- ing would begin, followed grape cotton harvests. On northern border hardly day went without firing. One night kibbutz hit border raiders, sabotaged ['1 Yolek', '2 Azariah'] 102 
sabotaged water pumps, blew empty tin shack citrus groves, crossed back Jordan dawn. Nearly everyone—men, women, children spent hour two weeding thin- ning cotton plants regular work day began. Azariah put fourteen-hour day keep farm machin- ery running. Even so, managed find time every evening sit campers, discuss defend kibbutz life, some- times lead song moonlit nights. On fourteenth May, watchman shot killed infiltrator perimeter fence. On seventeenth barley harvest ended wheat harvest began. The following day chamber quintet gave recital dining hall neighboring kibbutz. Two days later, evening began fall, Yonatan ['1 Azariah', '2 Yonatan'] 92 
Lifshitz returned. The next day back trac- tor shed work clothes never away. He grown black beard, turned brown lean Bedouin, little say ever. Chupka person, said, collared kiosk Yerucham. “Let’s go home, pal. You’ve caused enough trouble already,” said. “.Now get command car.” “Okay,” said Yonatan, “just let get things.” It evening finally arrived kibbutz, reluctantly kissed parents, reached touch brother, lugged knapsack, rifle, windbreaker, greasy blankets, dirty sleeping bag back place. While shower, asked Azariah throw things overhead closet put rifle chest bed. When emerged, asked new. And said more. Until Rimona stated, “Okay. I’m back.’ “You look nice beard,” said. “And tan. And must hungry.” The two them, Azariah ['1 Azariah', '2 Rimona'] 112 
Azariah Yoni, slept living room night, leaving bedroom Rimona. They continued following nights too, Yoni couch Azariah floor. They moved radio room could listen news. “Tia looks fine,” said Yoni ['1 Yoni', '2 Azariah'] 30 
Yoni one night falling asleep. “And took good care garden too.” “I promised I would,” said Azariah. Every morning rose early go tractor shed, re- turning nightfall plenty work. Then would shower, drink cold tea coffee, sometimes play game chess. Azariah rule, though sometimes adjourned midway. Seated chess table pondering move, Yonatan, black beard, slightly sunken eyes, cast new-found seriousness mouth, resembled young scholar proud old rabbinical stock studying be- come rabbi. Yolek, however, one rare moments lu- cidity, made face muttered, "Yoh. Azoy vi vilde chayeh. “Yes, like wild animal.” Yolek’s hearing aid gathering dust. Most day would sit garden dusk would push wheelchair back house. For day two, seemed, new pastime: Bolognesi knitting lessons. Yet completing ten twenty rows stitches enough. Most time slept. He would doze sitting even bedtime would refuse lie down. With throw knees, drop ['1 Azariah', '2 Bolognesi'] 140 
drop hanging tip nose, spittle drying corners mouth, Yolek could sit sleeping nearly twenty-four hours day. On summer nights Prime Minister Eshkol sit long midnight Jerusalem office, secretaries gone home, night operator dozing telephone, bodyguard couch entrance, city lights shimmering windows, heavy trucks growling outside. Leaning elbows desk piled high documents letters, Prime Minister would bury face hands. At last chauffeur would appear politely suggest, “Excuse me, sir, perhaps we’d better go home.” “Right are, yunger mann," Eshkol ['1 Yolek', '2 Eshkol'] 78 
Eshkol would reply. “Geendikt. Let's go home. What here?” At end summer Azariah Yoni make wine winter come. Yoni ['1 Azariah', '2 Yoni'] 19
